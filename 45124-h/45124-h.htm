<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>

<p>The conveniences, the comforts, and luxuries conferred
on Society by the many important Inventions
of the present century, must naturally excite a desire
to know the origin and progress of the application of
scientific principles, by which such advantages have
been gained.</p>

<p>Practically considered, those Inventions are of
much greater value than the discoveries of Science
on which most of them depend; and the scientific inquirer
who confines his views to abstract principles,
without looking beyond them to the varied methods
of their application to useful purposes, may be compared
to a traveller who, having toiled arduously to
gain the top of a mountain, then shuts his eyes on
the prospect that lies before him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>
To the inquiring youth, more particularly, it is
desirable that he should be enabled to satisfy his wish
to know by what means such wonders as Steam Navigation,
Locomotion on Railways, the Electric Telegraph,
and Photography have been gradually developed;
and in becoming acquainted with the successive
steps by which they have advanced towards their
present perfection, he will at the same time learn a
useful lesson of perseverance under difficulties, and
will have his mind impressed with many valuable
scientific truths. The knowledge to be gained by such
inquiry is eminently practical, and of a kind which
those engaged in any of the pursuits of life can
scarcely fail to require.</p>

<p>A History of Inventions almost necessarily implies
a description of the mechanisms and processes by
which they are effected; so far, at least, as to render
the principles on which their actions depend understood.
It would be impossible, however, in a work
of this limited size to enter minutely into explanations
of mechanisms, and into the applications of scientific
discoveries, which would require a separate treatise
for each; but it has been the Author's endeavour to
give a succinct, intelligible account, free from technicalities,
of the manner in which they operate, so as to
be comprehensible to all classes of readers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">ix</a></span>
By thus giving a popular character to the work,
to make it acceptable to the young, it is hoped that
it will not be found less worthy, on that account, the
perusal of those more advanced in life.</p>

<p>When Beckman wrote his History of Inventions,
towards the close of last century, scarcely any of the
wonderful discoveries and contrivances that now form
parts of our social system were known; and the table
of contents of his two large volumes affords a curious
insight to the nature and limited extent of such contrivances
as were then considered most important.
The introduction into his history of such subjects as
canary birds, carp, the adulteration of wine, apothecaries,
cock-fighting, and juggling, lead us to infer
that the Historian of Inventions at that time must
have had some difficulty to find appropriate matter
wherewith to fill his volumes. The opposite difficulty
now presents itself. The numerous important, wonderful,
and curious accomplishments of human skill
and ingenuity during the present century render preference
perplexing, where so many deserve description.
From among the number that press for notice,
the Author has endeavoured to select those that are
either the most important, the most remarkable, or
that seem to possess the germs of future progress;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">x</a></span>
and he trusts that the selection he has made, and the
mode in which the subjects have been treated, will
render this volume interesting and instructive.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="THE_PROGRESS_OF_INVENTION" id="THE_PROGRESS_OF_INVENTION">THE PROGRESS OF INVENTION.</a></h2>

<p>The inventive faculty of man tends more directly
than any other intellectual power he possesses to raise
him in the scale of creation above the brutes. Nearly
every advance he makes beyond the exercise of his
natural instincts is caused by invention&mdash;by that power
of the mind which combines known properties in different
ways to obtain new results.</p>

<p>When an Indian clothes himself with the skins of
animals, and when he collects the dried leaves of the
forest for his bed, he is either an original inventor, or
he is profiting by the inventions of others. Those
simple contrivances&mdash;the first steps in the progress of
invention&mdash;are succeeded by the more labored efforts
of inventive genius, such as contriving means of shelter
from rain, or from the heat of the sun, when caves
cannot be found to creep into, or the overhanging
foliage fails to afford sufficient covering. The construction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
of places of shelter is an imitation of the
protection formed by Nature; and the rudest hut and
the most magnificent palaces have their prototypes
in caverns and in the interlacing branches of trees.</p>

<p>Nature also supplies knowledge of the means by
which inventors are enabled to work. The savage who
seizes hold of a broken bough is in possession of the
<i>lever</i>, the uses of which he learns by the facility it
affords in moving other objects. He ascends to the
top of a precipice by walking up the sloping hill
behind, and he thus becomes practically acquainted
with the principle of the <i>inclined plane</i>. The elements
of all the mechanical powers are then at his command,
to be applied by degrees in administering to
his wants, as his inventive faculties, guided by observation
and experience, suggest. An accidental kick
against a loose stone shows the action of propulsive
force; and the stone that he has struck with his foot,
he learns to throw with his hand. The bending of
the boughs of trees to and fro by the wind teaches
the action of springs; and in the course of time the
bow is bent by a strip of hide, and the relaxation of
the spring, after farther bending, propels the arrow.
Observation and imitation thus lead to invention, and
every new invention forms the foundation of further
progress.</p>

<p>It has been so with every invention at present
known, and must so continue to the end of time:&mdash;"There
is nothing new under the sun." Gas lighting,
Steam locomotion, and the Electric Telegraph have
each sprung from some source "old as the hills,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
though so modified by gradually progressive changes,
that the giant we now see bears no resemblance to
the infant of ages past.</p>

<p>The observation that light particles floating in the
air are attracted by amber when rubbed, which was
made known six centuries before the Christian era,
was the origin of the invention by which communications
are now transmitted, with the rapidity of
lightning, from one part of the world to another.
There is no apparent relation between effects so dissimilar;
yet the steps of progress can be distinctly
traced, from the attraction of a feather to the development
of the electric telegraph.</p>

<p>Whenever the history of an invention can be thus
tracked backward to its source, it will be found to
have advanced to its present state by progressive
steps, each additional advance having been dependent
on the help given by the progress before made. Sometimes
these onward movements are greater and more
remarkable than others, and the persons who made
them have become distinguished for their inventive
genius, and are considered the benefactors of mankind;
yet they were but the followers of those who had
gone before and shown the way.</p>

<p>Many of the most remarkable inventions are attributable
to accidents noted by observing and inventive
minds. Not unfrequently also have important discoveries
of truth been made in endeavouring to establish
error; and new light is being constantly thrown on
the path of invention by unsuccessful experiments.</p>

<p>This view of the means by which inventions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
originate and are brought to perfection may appear
to detract from the merit of inventors, since it regards
them as founding their conceptions altogether on the
works of others, or on chance. But instead of diminishing
their claims to approbation and reward, it
places those claims on a more substantial foundation
than that of abstract original ideas. The man who
has the faculty to perceive that by a different application
of well-known principles he can produce useful
effects before unknown, directly benefits mankind far
more than the discoverer of the principles which had
till then lain dormant; and the numerous difficulties
which ever arise before an invention can be practically
operative, frequently afford exercise for reasoning
powers of the highest kind, which may develop new
arrangements, that exhibit as much originality and
research as were displayed by the discoverers of the
principles on which the invention depends.</p>

<p>The dependence of every invention on preceding
ones produces very frequently conflicting claims among
inventors, who, forgetting how much they were indebted
to others, do not hesitate to charge those, who
make still further improvements, with imitation and
piracy. It is, indeed, sometimes difficult to determine
whether the alterations made in well-known contrivances
are, or are not, of sufficient importance to
constitute inventions; and there can be no doubt that
there is too great facility afforded, by the indiscriminate
grant of letters patent, for the establishment of
monopolies that often serve to obstruct further improvements.
At the same time, it must be observed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
that a very trifling addition or change occasionally
gives practical value to an invention, which had been
useless without it. In such cases, though the individual
merit of the inventor is small, the benefit
conferred may be important, and may operate influentially
in promoting the progress of civilization.</p>

<p>Scientific discovery goes hand in hand with invention,
and they mutually assist each other's progress.
Every discovery in science may be applicable to some
new purpose, or give greater efficiency to what is old.
Those new and improved instruments and processes
provide science with the means of extending its
researches into other fields of discovery; and thus, as
every truth revealed, supplies inventive genius with
fresh matter to mould into new forms, those creations
become in their turn agents in promoting further
discoveries.</p>

<p>The action and reaction thus constantly at work,
tend to give accelerating impulse to invention, and
are continually enlarging its sphere of operations.
Instead, therefore, of supposing, as some do, that
invention and discovery have nearly reached their
limits, there is more reason to infer that they are only
at the commencement of their careers; and that, great
as have been the wonders accomplished by the applications
of science during the first half of the present
century, they will be at least equalled, if not surpassed,
by those to be achieved before its close.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="STEAM_NAVIGATION" id="STEAM_NAVIGATION">STEAM NAVIGATION.</a></h2>

<p>Ships, propelled by some mysterious power against
wind and against tide, cutting their ways through the
water without apparent impulse and like things of
life, were not unfrequently seen gliding along in the
regions of fancy, ages before the realization of such
objects on geographical seas and rivers was looked
upon as in the slightest degree possible. Even at the
beginning of the present century, it seemed to be
more probable that man would be able to navigate
the air at will, than that he should be able, without
wind or current, and in opposition to both, to propel
and steer large ships over the waves; yet, within
twenty years afterwards, Steam Navigation had ceased
to be a wonder.</p>

<p>If we look back into the records of past ages, we
find that inventive genius was active in the earliest
times, in endeavouring to find other means of propelling
boats than by manual labour and the uncertain
wind, some of which contrivances point to the
method subsequently adopted by the constructors of
steam-vessels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
To enable us to appreciate properly the gradual
advances that have been made in perfecting any
invention, it is necessary to consider its distinguishing
features, and the difficulties which inventors have
had successively to contend against. On taking this
view of the progress of Steam Navigation, it will be
found that the amount of novelty to which each
inventor has a claim is very small, and that his principal
merit consists in the application of other inventions
to accomplish his special object. The same
remark will indeed apply to most other inventions;
for the utmost that inventive genius can accomplish,
is to put together in new forms, and with different
applications, preceding contrivances and discoveries,
which were also the results of antecedent knowledge,
labour, and skill.</p>

<p>When, for instance, we look upon an ordinary steam-boat,
the most remarkable and the most important feature
is the paddle-wheel, by the action of which against
the water the boat is propelled. Yet that method
of propelling boats was practised by the Egyptians
hundreds of years before steam power was thought
of; and the ancient Romans made use of similar
wheels, worked by hand, as substitutes for oars. It
would seem, therefore, to be only a small step in
inventive progress, after the discovery of the steam
engine, to apply that motive power to turn the
paddle-wheels which had been previously used; and
now that we see the perfected invention, it may surprise
those who are unacquainted with the difficulties
which attend any new appliance, that Steam Navigation
did not sooner become an accomplished fact.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
In a book called "Inventions and Devices," by
William Bourne, published in 1578, it was proposed to
make a boat go by paddle-wheels, "to be turned by
some provision." The Marquis of Worcester, in his
"Century of Inventions," also speaks vaguely of a mode
of propelling ships. But Capt. Savery, the inventor
of the earliest working steam engine, was the first to
suggest the application of steam to navigation; and Dr.
Papin, who contended with Savery for priority of
the invention, also suggested about the same time the
application of the elastic force of steam to that purpose.</p>

<p>These crude notions, however, do not deserve to be
considered as inventions, though they probably assisted
in suggesting the idea of the plan proposed by Mr.
Jonathan Hulls, who in 1736 took out a patent for
a steam-boat, and in the following year published a
description of his invention, illustrated by a drawing,
entitled, "A description and draught of a new-invented
machine for carrying vessels or ships out of
or into any harbour, port, or river, against wind or
tide, or in a calm."</p>

<p>The greater part of this publication is occupied with
answers to objections that he supposed might be raised
to the scheme, and in the preface he makes the following
observations on the treatment inventors were
exposed to in his day, which we fear will apply equally
at the present time. "There is," he says, "one great
hardship lies too commonly on those who purpose to
advance some new though useful scheme for the
public benefit. The world abounding more in rash
censure than in candid and unprejudiced estimation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
things, if a person does not answer their expectations
in every point, instead of friendly treatment for his
good intentions, he too often meets with ridicule and
contempt."</p>

<p>At the time of Mr. Hulls' invention, Watt had not
made his improvements in the steam engine, and the
kind of engine Hulls employed was similar to Newcomen's,
in which the steam was condensed in the
cylinder, and the piston, after being forced down by
the direct pressure of the atmosphere, was drawn
upwards again by a weight. The paddle, or "vanes,"
as he called them, were placed at the stern, between
two wheels, which were turned by ropes passing over
their peripheries. The alternate motion of the piston
was ingeniously converted into a continuous rotary
movement, by connection with other ropes attached
to the piston and to the weight, the backward movement
being prevented by a catch or click.</p>

<p>The woodcut which lays before you is a reduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
copy of Hulls' "draught" of his steam-boat, as
given in his book, a copy of which is preserved in the
British Museum.</p>

<p>The utmost application of steam power to navigation
contemplated by Hulls was to tow large vessels
into or out of harbour, in calm weather, by means of
a separate steam tug-boat, as he considered the cumbersome
mechanism would be found objectionable on
board the ships to be thus propelled. It does not
appear that this plan was effectually tried, nor was
the arrangement of the mechanism, nor the imperfect
condition of the steam engine at that period, calculated
to make the effort successful.</p>

<p>For some years after Mr. Hulls' plan had been
published, and had proved abortive, no further attempt
seems to have been made, until the improvements in
the steam engine, by Watt, rendered it more applicable
for the purpose of navigation. The French
claim for the Marquis de Jouffroy the honour of
having been the first who successfully applied steam
power to propel boats, in 1782; though another French
nobleman, the Comte d'Auxiron, and M. Perier, had
eight years previously made some experiments with
steam-boats on the Seine. The Marquis de Jouffroy's
steam-boat, which was 145 feet long, was tried on the
Soane, near Lyons, with good promise of success.
The marquis was, however, obliged to leave France by
the fury of the Revolution, and when he returned in
1796, he found that a patent had been granted to
M. le Blanc, for building steam-boats in France. He
protested against the monopoly, but the patent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
remained in force, and the plan received no further
development, either from the Marquis de Jouffroy, or
the patentee.</p>

<p>About five years later, Mr. Patrick Miller, of Dalswinton,
in Scotland, directed his attention to the
propulsion of boats by mechanical means, and contrived
different kinds of paddles, and other propellers
to be worked by hand, which were tried on boats on
Dalswinton Lake. The great labour required to work
these machines induced Mr. James Taylor, a tutor in
Mr. Miller's family, to suggest the use of steam power
to turn them, and he recommended Mr. Miller to
obtain the assistance of William Symington, an engineer,
who was at that time endeavouring to make a
steam locomotive carriage. Among the first difficulties
that suggested themselves, was the danger of setting
fire to the boat by the engine furnace. This difficulty
was overcome by Mr. Taylor, and the arrangements
were completed, and the experiment was tried in 1788.
The steam engine and mechanism were applied to a
double pleasure-boat; the engine being placed on one
side, the boiler on the other, and the paddle-wheel in
the centre. The cylinders of the steam engine were
only four inches in diameter; but with this engine
the boat was propelled across Dalswinton Lake at a
speed of five miles an hour.</p>

<p>The success of this experiment induced Mr. Miller
to have a larger boat built, expressly adapted for the
introduction of a steam engine. It was constructed
under the superintendence of Symington, and was
tried successfully on the Forth and Clyde Canal in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
1789, when it was propelled at the rate of seven miles
an hour.</p>

<p>In the arrangement of the mechanism of this boat,
the cylinder was placed horizontally, for the purpose
of making connection between the paddle-wheel and
the piston, without the working beam. The piston
was supported in its position by friction wheels, and
communicated motion to the paddles by a crank. The
paddles were placed in the middle of the boat, near
the stern; and there was a double rudder, connected
together by rods which were moved by a winch at the
head of the vessel.</p>

<p>It is not very clear why Mr. Miller did not follow
up this success. Objection, indeed, was made by the
proprietors of the canal on account of the agitation of
the water, which it was feared would injure the banks.
It would appear also that a misunderstanding took
place between Miller and Symington, which gave the
former a distaste to the undertaking; and having
shown that such a plan was practicable, he left others
to carry it into practical effect.</p>

<p>Several methods of propelling boats, otherwise than
by paddles, had some years previously been suggested;
among which were two that have been again and
again tried by succeeding inventors, down to the present
day.</p>

<p>One of these is an imitation of the duck's foot,
which expands when it strikes the water, and collapses
when it is withdrawn. The other is the ejection of a
stream of water at the stern, or on both sides of the
boat, so as to produce a forward movement by reaction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
Both these plans of propulsion seem feasible
in design; but they have hitherto failed in practice.
A pastor at Berne, named J.&nbsp;A. Genevois, has the
credit of having invented the duck-feet propeller in
1755; and in 1795, six years after Mr. Miller's successful
experiments, Earl Stanhope had a steam-boat
built on that principle. It was so far a failure, that it
was not propelled faster than three miles an hour.
The other method of propulsion, though of older date,
was patented in 1800 by Mr. Linnaker, who proposed
to draw the water in at the head of the vessel, and
eject it at the stern, and thus to obtain a double action
on the water for propelling; but the plan was not
found to answer.</p>

<p>In 1801, Lord Dundas revived Mr. Miller's project,
and availed himself of Mr. Symington's increased
experience and the further improvements in the steam
engine, to construct a much more perfect steam-boat
than any that had been made. He spent £3,000
in the experiments, and in March, 1802, his vessel,
called the "Charlotte Dundas," was tried on the same
scene of action, the Forth and Clyde Canal. This
boat, according to Symington's report, towed two
vessels, each of seventy tons burthen, a distance of
nineteen miles and a half in six hours, against a strong
wind. The threatened injury to the banks of the
canal by the great agitation of the water prevented
the use of this boat, which was consequently laid
aside; for the views of the inventors of steam-boats in
the first instance were limited to their employment to
drag boats along canals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
We now approach a period when more decided
advances and more rapid progress were made towards
realizing steam navigation as a practical fact. Mr.
Fulton, an American, residing in France, after making
a number of experiments, under the sanction and
with the assistance of Mr. Livingstone, the American
Ambassador, launched a small steam-boat on the Seine
in 1803, but the weight of the engine proved too
great for the strength of the boat, which broke in the
middle, and immediately went to the bottom.</p>

<p>Not disheartened by this failure he built another
one, longer and stronger, and this he succeeded in
propelling by steam power, though very slowly. It
was, indeed, a much less successful effort than the
attempts of Mr. Miller and Lord Dundas. Having
been threatened with opposition by M. le Blanc, the
patentee of steam-boats in France, Fulton determined
to return to his native country, where the large
navigable rivers and lakes offered ample scope for the
development of steam navigation. Having heard of
the success of Symington's boats, he visited Scotland
for the purpose of profiting by his experience; and he
induced Symington, by promises of great advantages
if the invention succeeded in America, to show him
the "Charlotte Dundas" at work, and to enter into
full explanations of every part. Thus primed with
the facts, and with the further suggestions of Symington,
Fulton repaired to New York. Mr. Livingstone,
who had assisted Fulton in his experiments, was
himself an inventor of several plans of propelling
vessels by steam, and in 1798 he obtained a patent in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
the State of New York, for twenty years, on condition
that he should produce a steam-boat by the 7th of
March, 1799, that would go at the rate of <i>four</i> miles
an hour. Having failed to fulfil that condition, the
patent privilege was left open, and was promised to
the first inventor who succeeded in propelling a boat
by steam power at the proposed speed of four miles an
hour. Fulton, who had entered into partnership with
Mr. Livingstone, possessed advantages in the construction
of the vessel he built in America, far greater than
any previous inventor. He had not only gained knowledge
by his former failures, but he was able to profit
by the experience of others, and he had secured a
superior steam engine, manufactured by Boulton and
Watt, of twenty-horse power. This was a much more
powerful engine than any that had been used in
any former experiment; the one employed by Mr.
Livingstone having had only five-horse power. This
steam-vessel was launched at New York in 1807, and
was called the "Clermont," the name of Mr. Livingstone's
residence on the banks of the Hudson. Its
length was 133 feet, depth 7 feet, and breadth 18 feet.
The boiler was 20 feet long, 7 feet deep, and 8 feet
broad. There was only one steam cylinder, which was
2 feet in diameter, with a length of stroke of 4 feet.
The paddle-wheels were 15 feet in diameter, and
5 feet broad; and the burthen of the vessel was 160
tons. Crowds of spectators assembled to see the boat
start on its first experimental voyage. The general
impression, even of those who were friendly to Fulton,
was that it would fail, and an accident which occurred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
when the vessel was under way confirmed this opinion.
The foreboders of evil exclaimed immediately that
they had "foreseen something of the kind;" and
observed "it was a pity so much expense had been
incurred for nothing!" The required repairs were,
however, soon made. The vessel when again tried cut
her way bravely through the water, to the astonishment
of all, and the doubts, and fears, and lamentations
were quickly changed into congratulations.</p>

<p>As the "Clermont" urged its way up the Hudson,
its chimney emitting innumerable sparks from the
dried pine wood used as fuel, it excited great alarm
among those who were not prepared for such an apparition.
An American paper of that day thus described
the effect produced on the crews of other ships in the
river:&mdash;"Notwithstanding the wind and tide were
adverse to its approach, they saw with astonishment
that it was rapidly coming towards them; and when
it came so near that the noise of the machinery and
paddles was heard, the crews, in some instances,
shrunk beneath their decks from the terrific sight,
or left their vessels to go on shore; whilst others
prostrated themselves and besought Providence to protect
them from the approach of the horrible monster
which was marching on the waves, and lighting its
path by the fires which it vomited."</p>

<p>During the time that Fulton was building his
steam-boat Mr. R.&nbsp;L. Stevens, of Hoboken, in the
State of New Jersey, was also engaged in a similar
undertaking. Though his name is comparatively little
heard of in the history of Steam Navigation, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
efforts were more successful than any that had been
made previously, and but for the fortunate chance to
Fulton that he was able to launch and put his boat in
action a few days before Stevens had completed his,
all, and more than all, the merit that is now ascribed
to the former would have been attributed to Stevens.
The previous successful experiment of Fulton having
fulfilled the conditions imposed by the State of New
York, he obtained the exclusive right of steam navigation
on the rivers and along the coast of that State;
therefore, after Stevens had launched his boat on the
Hudson, he was unable to employ it there. In this
predicament he ventured on the hazardous experiment
of taking his steam-vessel by sea, and successfully
accomplished his voyage from New York to Delaware.
This was the first attempt to put to sea in a steam-boat.</p>

<p>Mr. Stevens introduced many important improvements.
He increased the length of stroke of the
engines; he applied upright guides for the piston-rod,
to supply the place of the parallel motion; and
he divided the paddle-wheel by boards, by which
means a more uniform motion was obtained. By these
improvements he succeeded in raising the speed of
steam-vessels to thirteen miles an hour.</p>

<p>Whilst Steam Navigation was making such progress
in America, it was not neglected in this country.
Mr. Henry Bell, of Glasgow, a man of great ingenuity,
had for some time directed his attention to the subject,
and had given some useful hints to Fulton. Seeing,
as he afterwards said, no reason why others should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
profit by his plans without his participation in the
fame and the profits, he determined to build a steam-boat
himself, which was completed and launched in
1811. Bell called his boat the "Comet," in commemoration
of the remarkable eccentric luminary which
was at that time frightening Europe from its propriety.
The boat was 25 tons burthen, with an
engine of about 3-horse power. It plied on the Frith
of Forth for a distance of 27 miles, which in ordinary
weather it accomplished in 3½ hours. The "Comet"
is generally supposed to have been the first steam-boat
that plied regularly in Europe; and its construction
was so perfect, that no boat built for many years
afterwards surpassed it, taking into consideration its
size and the small power of its engine. Bell, though
he had done so much to advance Steam Navigation
in this country, was allowed to suffer neglect and
penury in his old age, till the town of Glasgow granted
him a small annuity for his services.</p>

<p>A claim has been preferred on behalf of Messrs.
Furnace and Ashton, of Hull, to priority in building
the first steam-vessel that was worked in England. It
is stated, that "about the year 1787, experiments were
made on the river Hull, by Furnace and Ashton, on
the propulsion of vessels by steam power. Furnace
and Ashton built a boat, which plied on the river,
between Hull and Beverley, for some time, and answered
exceedingly well. In consequence of the good
results of their experiments, they built a much larger
vessel and engine, and sent the whole to London, to
be put together and finished; after which it was subjected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
to the severest tests, and gave the greatest
satisfaction. The vessel was bought by the Prince
Regent (afterwards George IV.), who had it fitted and
furnished as a pleasure yacht; but it was soon afterwards
burnt, having, it is supposed, been wilfully set
on fire by persons who were afraid that such an
invention would be injurious to their calling. The
Prince was so much pleased with the invention and
ingenuity of Furnace and Ashton, that he granted
them a pension for their lives of £70 a year <span class="locked">each."<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></span>
This steamer was on the paddle-wheel principle, propelled
by a steam engine, to which was attached a
copper boiler.</p>

<p>From this time forward the progress of Steam Navigation
was very rapid. Steam-ships were built longer
and larger, and with more powerful engines; and the
most skilful builders rivalled each other in the construction
and adaptation of their vessels and engines,
so as to attain the highest possible speed. The
locality in which Steam Navigation may be said to
have had its birth continued for a long time to be
pre-eminent, and steam-boats built on the Clyde still
rank very high, if not the highest, in the scale of excellence.</p>

<p>The ordinary land steam engine required considerable
alterations to adapt it to marine purposes; nor
was it till great experience had been gained in propelling
vessels by steam power, that the more essentially
requisite modifications were adopted. It was
found important, in the first place, to reduce the space
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>occupied by the machinery as much as possible. The
boilers were consequently made of less dimensions,
but more extensive in their heating surface. It was
also found desirable to employ two engines instead of
one, the pistons being made to rise and descend alternately.
By this means the motion was rendered more
equable, and by placing the cranks of the common
shaft at right angles, the "dead points" were passed
more readily, and the want of a fly wheel was thus
compensated.</p>

<p>The steam-boats employed in this country were,
almost from the first, and continue with few exceptions
to be, on the low-pressure condensing principle;
the whole of the machinery being placed below the
deck. This renders it necessary to diminish the height
of the engines as much as possible; and in all marine
steam engines, till within the last twenty years, instead
of having a working beam over the cylinders, a
cross-head was placed at the top of the piston-rod, the
action of which was conveyed by parallel motions to
cross beams on each side, which were situated at the
bottom part of each engine. The motion, compared
with that of an ordinary land engine, was thus inverted.
The proportions of the cylinders were also different;
the length of stroke being shorter, to diminish
the height, and the diameter consequently greater.
The valves, and the gearing connected with them, the
air pump, the condenser, and other subsidiary parts,
do not differ essentially from those of land engines;
but the governor is omitted, as it is found impracticable
to work a marine engine with great regularity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
Latterly, many engineers have introduced, with
much success, arrangements for communicating the
action directly from the piston-rod to the crank, without
the intervention of the beam and parallel motions.
This is generally done by causing the piston-rod to
work between guides, and a jointed arm connects it
with the crank. One method of producing the same
effect is to make the cylinders oscillate on pivots, as
contrived by Mr. Murdoch, in the first model steam
carriage, made in 1784. This principle has been
successfully carried into operation by Messrs. Penn,
of Greenwich. The oscillating cylinders accommodate
themselves to the varying directions of the
cranks, and the strain occasioned by guide rods is
diminished; but when very large cylinders are
required, the friction and the pressure on the pivots
must tend to counterbalance the advantage otherwise
obtained.</p>

<p>In the ordinary paddle-wheel steam-boats, the
floats of the paddle-wheels are fixed at equal distances
round the rim, radiating from the centre; therefore
they enter and come out of the water obliquely.
There is, consequently, a considerable loss of power
attending the use of such paddle-wheels, as only one
float at a time can be acting vertically on the water,
and exerting the propelling force in a direct line.
Several attempts have been made to remedy this
defect, and to produce what is called "feathering"
floats, every one of which will act against the water
at right angles. The mechanism required for making
this adjustment is, however, liable to get out of order,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
and the introduction of vertically acting floats has
consequently been very limited.</p>

<p>The large projecting paddle-boxes are objectionable
in sea-going ships, as they present so large a surface to
the action of the wind, and either impede the course
of the ship, or make it unweatherly. This inconvenience
was experienced in the early progress of Steam Navigation,
and many attempts were made to overcome
it, by substituting a different kind of propeller.
Recourse was had to the inventions of the ancients, from
whom the paddle-wheel was taken, to find some other
means of propulsion. A method of propulsion, similar
in principle to the action of sculls at the back of a boat,
had been contrived long before the inconvenience of
paddle-wheels in Steam Navigation was experienced.
In 1784, Mr. Bramah obtained a patent for a propeller
similar in its forms to the vanes of a windmill, which
by acting obliquely on the water as it revolved,
pushed the boat forward. Ten years afterwards, an
"aquatic propeller" was patented by Mr. William
Lyttleton, a merchant in London. It consisted of a
single convolution of a three-threaded screw, and may
be considered to be the first screw propeller invented.
Numerous other ingenious persons, among whom were
Tredgold, Trevethick, Maceroni, and Millington, afterwards
invented propellers on the screw principle;
but none of them were sufficiently satisfactory in
their results to come into practical use.</p>

<p>In 1836, Mr. Smith and Mr. Ericsson obtained a
patent for a screw propeller, which nearly resembled
Mr. Lyttleton's original contrivance; and by perseverance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
in struggling against the many obstacles with
which he had to contend, Mr. Smith succeeded,
though all previous efforts had failed. His partner,
however, became disheartened by the obstacles thrown
in their way, and left this country for America before
the success of the screw was established.</p>

<p>The first ship fitted with the screw propeller was
called the "Archimedes." It was a vessel of 237
tons burthen, with a draught of water of 9 feet 4
inches. The screw projected at the stern, and being
turned rapidly round by the steam engine, the oblique
action of the thread of the screw against the water
impelled the vessel forward.</p>

<p>The "Archimedes" was originally fitted with a
single-threaded screw, the threads of which were 8
feet apart, and there were two convolutions of the
screw round the shaft. One convolution of the screw
having been accidentally broken off, the ship was
found to go faster in consequence; and, following the
course of investigation suggested by the accident, Mr.
Smith at last adopted a double-threaded screw, with
only half a convolution. The average performance of
the engines was 26 strokes per minute, and the number
of revolutions of the screw in the same time was
138½. The "pitch" of the screw was 8 feet; that is,
the space across one entire convolution of the thread
would have measured 8 feet; consequently, had it
been acting against a solid body, as a cork-screw when
entering a cork, one revolution of the shaft would
have advanced the vessel 8 feet, and the speed would
have been 12½ miles an hour; but the utmost speed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
the "Archimedes" obtained was 9¼ nautical miles.
The difference was owing to the screw "slipping" in
the water, because the fluid yielded to the oblique
action of the blades.</p>

<div id="ip_24" class="figcenter" style="width: 282px;"><img src="images/i_b_024.jpg" width="282" height="290" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>The results of the working of that experimental
ship were so satisfactory, that other ships were soon
built, with modifications of the form of the propeller.
It was found disadvantageous to have an entire convolution
of the thread of the screw; for one part of it
worked in the wake of the other, and resistance was
produced by the backwater. After numerous experiments,
in which the dimensions of the screw were
successively diminished, the propeller was at length
reduced to two oblique blades. Experiments on a large
scale were conducted by Captain Carpenter, to determine
the size and angle of inclination best adapted for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
the purpose of propulsion; and nearly all the ships
now built for the Royal Navy are fitted with propellers
on his principle. The annexed diagram represents
on a scale of one-eighth of an inch to a foot, the form
of the propeller of the "Agamemnon," of 606-horse
power, which was recently engaged in successfully
laying down the Atlantic Telegraph cable. The
diameter of the screw is 18 feet, and the pitch 20 feet.</p>

<p>The screw propeller possesses great advantages in
ships of war, as it is not exposed to damage by shot,
and it leaves the entire deck clear for mounting guns.
It has also the further advantage of not interfering
with the working of sails, and is, therefore, admirably
adapted for sea-going ships that economize fuel by
alternately steaming and sailing, as the wind is adverse
or favourable. The commotion in the water made by
paddle-wheels, which is an objection to their use in
narrow rivers, is avoided by screw propellers, which
being immersed under the water, make little agitation
on the surface, and the ships move along without any
apparent impelling power.</p>

<p>The speed of ships with the best constructed screw
propellers is fully equal to that of paddle-wheel
vessels; and when two vessels of the same size, and
with engines of equal power, one fitted with paddles,
and the other with the screw, are fastened stem and
stern together, in a trial of strength, the screw propeller
has been found to have the advantage, and to
pull its antagonist along at the rate of one or two
miles an hour.</p>

<p>The difficulty at first experienced in the application<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
of the screw propeller was to communicate a sufficiently
rapid motion to the shaft to which it is fixed;
but, by the employment of direct-acting engines, this
difficulty has been for the most part overcome. The
power is generally first applied to drive a large cog-wheel,
the teeth of which take into the teeth of a
smaller cog-wheel fixed to the propeller shaft, and in
this manner the velocity is sufficiently increased.</p>

<p>In 1852 the proportion of screw to paddle-wheel
vessels building in the Clyde was as 43 to 30. The
advantages of the propeller are becoming every year
more appreciated, and it is rapidly superseding the
paddle-wheel.</p>

<p>In the steam-boats of the United States the engines
are constructed on the high-pressure principle; and by
working with steam of the pressure of 100 pounds on
the square inch, and with larger paddle-wheels, their
boats attain a speed exceeding sixteen miles an hour.
But numerous explosions of boilers on the North
American rivers have operated as a caution against the
introduction of high-pressure engines in steam-boats in
this country. The dread of high-pressure steam was
early impressed by the destructive explosion of the
boiler of a steam-vessel at Norwich in 1817, which led
to a long parliamentary inquiry into the subject; and
the subsequent loss of life by the explosion of the
"Cricket" on the Thames, has tended to strengthen
the apprehension of high-pressure steam engines. For
river use, however, when fresh water is always at
command for generating the steam, there appears to
be no more cause for fear of high-pressure engines in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
boats than on railways, provided the boilers are constructed
with sufficient care. The experiments made
by Mr. Fairbairn on the strength of boilers, the results
of which were communicated at the meeting of the
British Association in 1853, prove, that by increasing
the number and strength of the "stays," or internal
supports, of the boilers, they may be made, if sufficiently
strong, to resist any possible pressure; and that
the square shape, which was supposed to be the weakest,
offers, on the contrary, peculiar facilities for giving
increased strength. In one of these experiments made
to determine the ultimate strength of the flat surfaces
of boilers, when divided into squares of sixteen inches
area, the boiler did not give way until it had sustained
the enormous pressure of 1,625 pounds on the square
inch.</p>

<p>It might be desirable, in the construction of steam
boilers, to adopt the same principle that is introduced
in the building of gunpowder mills, one-half of which
is built in strong masonry, whilst the other is made of
wood. By this means, when an explosion does occur,
much less damage is done, for the lighter part only is
blown away, which does little injury. In the same
manner, steam engine boilers might be constructed
with a small portion comparatively weaker, so that
if it gave way there would not be much damage done.
Safety-valves are intended to act in that manner; and
if they were properly constructed, they would sufficiently
answer the purpose, and guard against the
possibility of danger; but the numerous accidents that
occur with boilers provided with imperfect safety-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>valves,
show that there is a necessity for some more
effectual protection. Engineers are not sufficiently
alive to the importance of improvements in this respect.
They supply an engine with safety-valves,
which would answer the purpose if kept in proper
condition; but they do not make effectual provision
against careless management and reckless misconduct.
Some years since, a gentleman in America sent to the
author a description, with drawings, of a safety-valve
that combined the principles of the safety-plug without
its inconvenience; it being so contrived that when
the boiler became too hot, it melted some fusible
metal which previously held down the valve, and then
a weight pulled it open to allow an ample escape of
steam; but when the heat was lowered, the valve
again closed. This was shown to an eminent engineer
for his opinion. He pronounced it to be very ingenious,
and that it would, no doubt, answer the purpose;
but he said, "<i>An improved safety-valve is not wanted</i>,
those in use being quite sufficient for the purpose."</p>

<p>In steam-ships, where salt water is used for generating
the steam, the incrustation on the sides of the
boilers becomes a serious annoyance. It obstructs the
communication of heat from the furnace to the water,
and the metal is thus liable to become red-hot. Numerous
plans have been adopted for the purpose of preventing
the accumulation of salt on the sides of the
boiler, the most common of which is to allow the
water, when saturated with saline matter, to escape,
and then to fill the boiler afresh. Among other contrivances
for effecting the same purpose, without the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
waste of heating power which the change of water
occasions, is Mr. Hall's plan of condensing the steam
in dry condensers, cooled externally, so that the distilled
water may be used again and again. This plan
though theoretically good, is not much adopted; for the
condensation of steam cannot be so well accomplished
by that means as when a jet of cold water is thrown
directly into the condenser. The principle of the dry
condenser has, however, been lately made available
in a new kind of engine, wherein the combined action
of steam and of spirit vapour is applied as the propelling
power.</p>

<p>Steam-boats had been for many years in extensive
use on the rivers and seas of Europe and America
before it was thought practicable to make voyages
in them across the Atlantic. At the meeting of the
British Association at Liverpool in 1837, that subject
was brought forward for consideration, and it was then
attempted to be shown, by calculations of the quantities
of coal requisite for such a voyage, that steam
communication with America would not be profitable,
if it could be accomplished, as the coal would occupy
so much of the tonnage as to leave scarcely any space
for passengers and goods. Within a few months
afterwards those calculations were set at nought by
the "Sirius" and the "Great Western," which successfully
crossed the Atlantic with passengers and
cargo, the former in nineteen days from Cork, and the
latter in sixteen. At the present time, steam-packets
are constantly crossing from New York to Liverpool in
eleven days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
Steam-ships now find their way to India and even
to Australia, though the necessity of taking in coals at
depôts supplied from England not only prolongs the
time, but adds so materially to the cost, as to render
steam communication with those distant places scarcely
practicable with profit, since no freight can pay for
the expense of coaling under such circumstances. To
overcome that difficulty, it was proposed to build ships
large enough to carry a supply of coals sufficient for
the voyage there and back. One of those ships has
been built for the Eastern Steam Navigation Company
by Mr. J. Scott Russell, from the plans of Mr. Brunel,
which is 675 feet long, 83 feet broad, and 60 feet deep.
It is adapted to carry 6,000 tons burthen, in addition
to the engines and requisite quantity of fuel, and to
accommodate 2,000 passengers. This monster ship
has been built on what is called the "wave principle"
of ship-building, with long concave bows. It is to be
propelled by the combined powers of the paddle-wheel
and the screw. The engines for the former consist of
4 oscillating cylinders, 16 feet long and 74 inches in
diameter, and the screw is to be worked by 4 separate
engines, with cylinders of 84 inches in diameter. The
speed which the "Great Eastern" is estimated to
attain is 24 miles an hour, and it is calculated that the
voyage to Australia will be accomplished in 30 days.
There seems, at present, but small prospect of those
calculations being realized, for the great cost incurred
in launching the vessel and other expenses have exhausted
the funds of the company by whom the ship
was constructed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
Another company has, however, been formed for
the purpose of completing, if possible, this great
experiment in Steam Navigation; and the opinion so
strongly expressed by Mr. Fairbairn at the recent
meeting of the British Association at Leeds, of the
strength of the monster ship, will give additional
stimulus to their exertions. The ship is built on the
same principle of construction as the Britannia Bridge
over the Menai Straits, and it was stated by Mr.
Fairbairn that it might be supported out of water,
either in the centre or at each end, without injury.</p>

<h2><a name="STEAM_CARRIAGES_AND_RAILWAYS" id="STEAM_CARRIAGES_AND_RAILWAYS">STEAM CARRIAGES AND RAILWAYS.</a></h2>

<p>No invention of the present century has produced
so great a social change as Steam Locomotion on railways.
Not only have places that were formerly more
than a day's journey from each other been made accessible
in a few hours, but the cost of travelling has
been so much reduced, that the expense has in a great
degree ceased to operate as a bar to communication by
railway for business or pleasure.</p>

<p>Though the coaching system in this country had
attained the highest degree of perfection, a journey
from London to Liverpool, previously to the formation
of railways, was considered a serious undertaking.
The "fast coach," which left London at one o'clock in
the day, did not profess to arrive in Liverpool till six
o'clock the following evening, and sometimes it did
not reach there till ten o'clock at night; and the fare
inside was four guineas, besides fees to coachmen and
guards. The same distance is now performed in six
hours, at one-third the expense, and at one-fourth the
fatigue and inconvenience.</p>

<p>Railway Locomotion, however, forms no exception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
to the rule, that most modern inventions have their
prototypes in the contrivances of ages past. They were
used upwards of two hundred years before locomotive
engines were known, or before the steam engine itself
was invented. The manifest advantage of an even
track for the wheels long ago suggested the idea of
laying down wood and other hard, smooth surfaces
for carriages to run upon. They were first applied to
facilitate the traffic of the heavily laden waggons
from the coal pits; the "tramways," as they were
called, being formed of timber about six inches square
and six feet long, fixed to transverse timbers or
"sleepers," which were laid on the road. These
original railways were made sufficiently wide for the
wheels of the waggons to run upon without slipping
off; the plan of having edgings to the rails, or flanges
to the wheels, not having been adopted till a later
period. To protect the wood from wearing away,
broad plates of iron were afterwards fixed on the tramways.</p>

<p>Cast iron plate rails were first used in 1767. The
flat plates on which the wheels ran were made about
three inches wide, with edges two inches high, cast
on the near side, to keep the wheels of the "trams"
on the tracks. These iron plates were usually cast in
lengths of six feet, and they were secured to transverse
wooden sleepers by spikes and oaken pegs. The
tramways were laid down on the surface of the country
without much regard to hills and valleys, the
horses that drew the trains being whipped to extra
exertion when they came to a hill, and in descending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
some of the steep inclines, the animals were removed,
and the loaded waggons were allowed to descend the
hills by their own gravity, the velocity being checked
by a break put on by a man who accompanied them.</p>

<p>The chief use of the tramways was to facilitate the
conveyance of coals from the pits to the boats; and
as the level of the pit's mouth was higher than that
of the water, it was an object, in laying down a tramway,
to make a continuous descent, if possible, for the
loaded trains to run down, the dragging back of the
empty ones being comparatively easy. Thus, though
"engineering difficulties" were not much considered
in the construction of those early railways, engineering
contrivances were adopted to diminish the draught,
by making the gradients incline in one direction.</p>

<p>Soon after the invention of the Steam Engine had
been practically applied to mining purposes, its power
was directed to draw the coal waggons on railways.
This was done about the year 1808; and, in
the first instance, the application of steam power was
limited to drawing the loaded waggons up steep inclines.
A stationary engine was erected at the top
of the incline, and the waggons were drawn up by a
rope wound round a large drum. This mode of traction
was afterwards extended, in many instances,
along the whole railway, so as to supersede the use
of horse power. The employment of stationary engines
in this manner was continued, even after the
invention of locomotive steam engines, to draw the
trains up inclines that were too steep for the power
of the small locomotives at first used to surmount;
nor has this plan been yet altogether abandoned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
The application of steam to the direct propulsion
of carriages was a comparatively slow process. It
was, indeed, contemplated by Watt, as a substitute
for horse power on common roads, though he does
not seem to have contrived any means by which it
might be done. The first known application of the
kind was made by Mr. Murdoch, an engineer in the
employment of Messrs. Boulton and Watt, who in
1784 constructed a working model of a steam carriage,
still preserved, and which formed one of the
most interesting objects in the Great Exhibition of
1851. The boiler of this model locomotive is made
of a short length of brass tube, closed with flat ends.
The furnace to generate the steam consists of a spirit
lamp. The steam is conducted directly from the
boiler to a single cylinder, which is mounted on a
pivot near the centre, so that by the movement of
the cylinder the piston-rod may adapt itself to the
varying positions of the crank. The two hind wheels
are fixed to the axle, and on the latter is the crank,
attached to the piston-rod. A single wheel in front
serves to guide the carriage, which is propelled by
the rotation of the two hind wheels. The elastic force
of the steam is directly applied as the moving power;
and after it has done its work in the cylinder, it is allowed
to escape into the air.</p>

<p>This first known application of steam as a locomotive
power is more perfect in its general arrangements
than many steam carriages that were subsequently
brought into operation; and in the plan of balancing
the cylinder on pivots, we perceive the origin of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
oscillating engines, which have been recently introduced
with much success in Steam Navigation. By
that arrangement there is attained the most direct application
of the piston-rod to the crank, with the least
loss of power.</p>

<p>Mr. Murdoch's intention was to employ such carriages
on common roads, but he did not proceed to
put his plan into operation. Several other engineers,
among whom was Symington&mdash;who, as we have before
seen, took an active part in the invention of
Steam Navigation&mdash;afterwards endeavoured to realize
Mr. Murdoch's ideas on a working scale; but the first
who succeeded in making a locomotive engine, that
ran with any success, were Messrs. Trevethick and
Vivian. In 1804 they constructed a locomotive engine,
which was employed on a mineral railway at
Merthyr Tydvil, in South Wales. The boiler of their
engine resembled the one in Mr. Murdoch's model,
in having circular flat ends; but, to increase the
heating surface, a flue was introduced in the middle
of the boiler, which passed through it and back again,
in the shape of the letter U. The lower part of the
tube formed the furnace, and the upper part returned
through the boiler into the chimney. The steam
was admitted into and escaped from the cylinder by
the working of a four-way cock, the contrivance of
the slide-valve being then unknown. On the axle
of the crank a cog-wheel was fixed, and, by means
of the usual gearing, it communicated motion to the
hind wheels, which were fixed to the axle, so that
when the wheels revolved the carriage was propelled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
It is a remarkable fact that this engine of Mr.
Trevethick's presents the first practical application of
high-pressure steam as a motive power. Watt had,
indeed, suggested the application of the impulsive
power of steam, and Mr. Murdoch's model locomotive
was necessarily constructed on that principle; but
until Mr. Trevethick's locomotive engine was in action,
no application of high-pressure steam had been
made on a working scale.</p>

<p>The projectors of locomotive engines were for
many years possessed with the notion that it was
necessary to have some contrivance to prevent the
wheels from slipping on the road, as it was supposed
that otherwise the wheels would be turned without
moving the carriage. Numerous plans were devised
for overcoming this imaginary difficulty; and though
experience proved that even on railways the adhesion
of the wheels was, in ordinary circumstances, sufficient,
yet various schemes continued to be tried for
the purpose of facilitating the ascent of hills. The
imitation of the action of horses' hoofs was one of the
means attempted, but such additional aids were eventually
found to be of no avail, and were discontinued.</p>

<p>All the endeavours that were made, in the first
instance, to apply steam power to locomotion, had in
view the propulsion of carriages on common roads,
the idea of constructing level railways through the
country, for facilitating the general traffic, being
looked upon as too visionary a project to be realized.
The inventors of locomotive engines consequently directed
their attention almost exclusively to the arrangement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
that would best apply steam power to
overcome the varying obstacles and undulations of
common roads.</p>

<p>It is very curious and interesting, in tracing the
progress of an invention, to observe the different
phases through which it has passed, before it has been
brought into the state in which it is ultimately applied.
It not unfrequently happens that the original
purpose sinks into insignificance, and is almost lost
sight of, as the invention becomes more fully developed.
Other objects, that were not perceived, or
were considered altogether impracticable, present
themselves, and are then pursued; and the invention,
when perfected, is very different from its original design.
Thus the endeavours of the first inventors of
Steam Navigation were confined to the construction
of steam-tugs that would propel the boats along canals,
or take a ship into harbour, the notion of fitting a
steam engine into a ship to propel it across the sea
not having been thought of. In the same manner, the
invention of Steam locomotion on railways was either
not contemplated in the first instance, or was considered
very subordinate to the construction of carriages
to be propelled by steam power on common roads.</p>

<p>Among the most successful of those engineers, who
constructed steam carriages to run on roads, were Mr.
Gurney, Mr. Birstall, Mr. Trevethick, Mr. Handcock,
and Colonel Maceroni. Mr. Gurney was one of the
first on the road. His steam carriage completed several
journeys very successfully, and proved the practicability
of employing steam power in locomotive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
engines many years before the first passenger railway
was brought into operation. This, like all other new
inventions, was, however, beset with difficulties,
among which the most annoying was the determined
obstruction the plan met with from the trustees of
public roads, who levied heavy tolls on the carriages,
and laid loose stones on the roads to stop them from
running, as the driving wheels were found to be destructive
to the roads. There was also considerable
danger in running steam carriages on the same roads
on which ordinary traffic was conducted, because the
strange appearance of the engines, their noise, and the
issuing steam, frightened the horses.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these difficulties, the importance
of applying steam as a locomotive power for passenger
traffic became so apparent, that a Committee of the
House of Commons was appointed in 1831, to consider
whether the plan could be adopted with safety on
common roads, and whether it should not be encouraged
by passing an Act of Parliament for regulating
the tolls chargeable on such carriages, and for preventing
the obstructions to which they had been exposed.
The evidence given before the Committee
was greatly in favor of steam carriages, and tended
to show that there was no insuperable difficulty to the
general adoption of them. The Committee accordingly
reported as <span class="locked">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Sufficient evidence has been adduced to convince
your <span class="locked">Committee&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"1st. That carriages can be propelled by steam
on common roads at an average speed of ten miles
an hour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
"2nd. That at that rate they have conveyed upwards
fourteen passengers.</p>

<p>"3rd. That their weight, including engines, fuel,
water, and attendants, may be under three tons.</p>

<p>"4th. That they can ascend and descend hills of
considerable elevation, with facility and safety.</p>

<p>"5th. That they are perfectly safe for passengers.</p>

<p>"6th. That they are not (or need not be, if properly
constructed) nuisances to the public.</p>

<p>"7th. That they will become a speedier and
cheaper mode of conveyance than carriages drawn by
horses.</p>

<p>"8th. That as they admit of greater breadth of
tire than other carriages, and as the roads are not
acted upon so injuriously as by the feet of horses in
common draught, such carriages will cause less wear
of roads than coaches drawn by horses.</p>

<p>"9th. That rates of toll have been imposed on
steam carriages which would prohibit them being
used on several lines of roads, were such charges permitted
to remain unaltered."</p>

<p>In defiance of this favourable report, experience
proved that there were defects in that system of locomotion
greater than its advocates were disposed to
admit, and that the mechanism was frequently broken
or disarranged by the constant jarring caused by the
roughness of the road. The alarm of the horses drawing
other carriages was also calculated to produce
fearful accidents.</p>

<p>So far, indeed, as regarded the power of locomotion,
the steam carriages were successful. The author<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
was witness of this success during a short excursion
in Colonel Maceroni's carriage, which ascended
hills and ran over rough roads with great ease, and
at a speed of twelve miles an hour. The practical
difficulties, however, were so great, that steam carriages
have not been able to compete with horse
power; for the original cost of the boiler and engine,
the necessary repairs, and the expense of fuel, amounted
to more than the cost and keep of horses. The
plan was practically tried for several weeks, in 1831,
by running a steam carriage for hire from Paddington
to the Bank of England. The carriage, of which
the annexed diagram is an outline, was one of those
constructed by Mr. Handcock. The engine was
placed behind the carriage, which was capable of
containing sixteen persons, besides the engineer and
guide. The latter was seated in front, and guided the
carriage by means of a handle, which turned the
fore wheels. The carriage was under perfect control,
and could be turned within the space of four yards.
With this carriage, Mr. Handcock stated he accomplished
one mile up hill at the rate of seventeen miles
an hour. The carriage loaded very well at fares<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
which would now be considered exorbitant, but the
frequent necessity for repairs rendered the enterprise
unsuccessful, and the steam carriage was taken off the
road.</p>

<div id="ip_42" class="figcenter" style="width: 247px;"><img src="images/i_b_041.jpg" width="247" height="135" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>The successful establishment of railways, and the
great advantages arising from them compared with
the ordinary means of conveyance, still further reduced
the chance of establishing Steam Locomotion
on roads, and the plan is now in abeyance, at least,
if it has not been abandoned. It is very possible,
however, that in the progress of invention, modifications
may be made in the steam engine, to adapt it
more successfully to the purpose; or more suitable
motive powers may be discovered, that may bring
mechanical locomotion on roads again into favour.</p>

<p>The successful application of Steam Locomotion
on railways cannot be dated more than thirty years
ago; yet in that short period its progress has been so
rapid, that but few traces of the old mode of travelling
by stage coaches are now to be seen.</p>

<p>Some locomotive steam carriages had, indeed,
been introduced on the Stockton and Darlington coal
railway, by Mr. George Stephenson, in 1825, but their
results were not so satisfactory as to induce the extension
of the plan to the other railways that were
then laid down in the coal districts of England. The
cylinders of those engines were vertical, and each of
the four wheels acted propulsively on the rails by
means of an endless chain running along cog-wheels
fixed on the axles. The utmost speed that could be
obtained by this means was eight miles an hour; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
so little were these engines calculated to solve the
problem of the practicability of steam locomotive engines,
that when the first passenger railway was projected,
from Liverpool to Manchester, it was proposed
to propel the carriages by the traction of ropes,
put in motion by stationary steam engines. The directors,
before finally determining on the system of
locomotion to be adopted, offered a premium of £500
for the best locomotive engine to run on that line.
The stipulations proposed, and the conditions which
the required engines were to fulfil, may be regarded
as a curious exposition of the limited views then taken
of the capabilities of Steam Locomotion on railways.
The engine "was to consume its own smoke; to be
capable of drawing three times its own weight at 10
miles an hour, with a pressure on the boiler not exceeding
50 pounds on the square inch; the whole to
be proved to bear three times its working pressure&mdash;a
pressure guage to be provided; to have two safety-valves,
one locked up; the engine and boiler to be
supported on springs, and rested on six wheels, if the
weight should exceed 4½ tons; height to the top of
the chimney not to exceed 15 feet; weight, including
water in boiler, not to exceed 6 tons, or less, if possible;
the cost of the engine not to exceed £550."</p>

<p>An engine, called the "Rocket," constructed by
Messrs. Booth and Stephenson, was the successful
competitor for the prize. It so far exceeded the required
conditions as to speed, that, when unattached
to any carriages, it ran at the rate of 30 miles an
hour. The principal cause of its successful action<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
was the introduction of a boiler perforated lengthwise
by many tubes, through which the heated air of the
furnace passed to the chimney, and by this means a
much larger evaporating surface was obtained than
in the boilers previously employed, with a single flue
passing through the centre. The tubes were of copper,
three inches in diameter, one end of each communicating
with the chimney, and the other with the
furnace. There were twenty-five of these tubes passing
through the boiler, and fixed water-tight at each
end.</p>

<p>The boiler was 3 feet 4 inches in diameter, and 6
feet long; and it exposed a heating surface of 117
square feet. There were two cylinders, placed in a
diagonal position, with a stroke of 16½ inches, and each
worked a wheel 4 feet 8½ inches diameter, the piston-rod
being attached externally to spokes of the driving
wheels. The draught of the chimney, aided by the
escaping steam from the cylinders, which was admitted
into it, served to keep the fuel in active combustion.
The "Rocket" weighed 41 tons; the tender,
with water and coke, 3 tons 4 cwt.; and two loaded
carriages attached, 9½ tons; so that the engine and
train together weighed about 19 tons. The boiler
evaporated 114 gallons of water in the hour, and consumed,
in the same time, 217 pounds of coke. The
average velocity of the train was 14½ miles per hour.</p>

<p>The accompanying woodcuts represent an elevation
of the "Rocket," and a section of its boiler. In
these figures, <i>a</i> is the fire-box or furnace, surrounded
on all sides with water, with the exception of the side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
perforated for the reception of the tubes; <i>b</i> is the
boiler; <i>d</i>, one of the steam cylinders; <i>e</i>, the chimney;
<i>h</i> and <i>i</i>, safety-valves; <i>f</i>, one of the connecting rods
for communicating motion to the driving wheels.</p>

<div id="ip_45" class="figcenter" style="width: 365px;"><img src="images/i_b_045.jpg" width="365" height="317" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>Three other engines competed with the "Rocket,"
two of which had attained great speed on previous
trials. These were the "Novelty," constructed by
Messrs. Braithwaite and Ericsson, which weighed
only 2¾ tons; and the "Sans Pareil," manufactured
by Mr. Arkworth, which weighed 4½ tons. On the
day of trial, the 6th of October, 1829, these two locomotive
engines were disabled by the bursting of some
of their pipes, and thus the field was left clear to the
"Rocket," for the fourth engine had no chance of
winning the prize.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
The "Rocket," indeed, more than fulfilled all the
conditions required by the directors of the railway,
who thereupon decided on employing locomotive engines
for the traffic on the line.</p>

<p>The "Rocket" has formed the model on which
all subsequent locomotive engines have been constructed;
for, though numerous alterations and improvements
have been made in details, and though
the size of the engines has been greatly enlarged, the
principle of construction remains essentially the same.
Among the improvements that have been introduced
by different inventors, is an increase in the number
of the tubes in the boiler, so as to facilitate the generation
of steam, some of the engines now made having
upwards of 100 tubes, though of smaller diameter
than those of the "Rocket." The boilers have also
been elongated, to enlarge the evaporating surface
and economize fuel. The cylinders are placed
horizontally, and they are generally fixed inside the
boiler, to prevent the cooling of the steam. The piston-rods
are attached to cranks on the axle, placed at
right angles to each other; and the engines are
generally mounted on six wheels, four of which are
driving wheels, made of larger size than the two
others, and they are coupled together by connecting
arms. The large and powerful engines on the Great
Western Railway have, however, only two driving
wheels, which are 8 feet in diameter. These engines
weigh as much as 31 tons, which is seven times more
than the weight of the "Rocket." They are capable
of taking a passenger train of 120 tons at an average<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
speed of 60 miles an hour on easy gradients; and the
effective power, as measured by a dynamometer, is
stated to be equal to 743 horses.</p>

<p>The accompanying engraving of one of the recently
constructed engines on the Great Western Railway
presents a remarkable difference in point of size and
general arrangement to the original prototype, from
which, however, it does not materially differ in the
principle of its construction.</p>

<div id="ip_47" class="figcenter" style="width: 414px;"><img src="images/i_b_047.jpg" width="414" height="289" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>The complete success of the "Rocket" having
settled the question of the mode of traction, the Directors
of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway
made increased efforts to complete the line, and to
open it for general traffic. In September, 1830, all
was ready for the opening, which it was determined
should take place with a ceremony indicative of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
importance of the great event. The principal members
of the Government consented to take part in the
inauguration of the railway, and the utmost interest
was excited throughout the country for the success of
an undertaking that promised to be the commencement
of a new era in travelling. The 15th of September
was the day appointed, and there were eight
locomotive engines provided to propel the same
number of trains of carriages, which were to form the
procession. All along the line there were crowds of
persons collected to witness the ceremony. The trains
started from the Liverpool end of the railway; and,
as they passed along, they were greeted by the cheers
of the astonished and delighted spectators. On arriving
at Parkside, seventeen miles from Liverpool,
the engines stopped to take in fresh supplies of fuel
and water. The passengers alighted and walked
upon the line, congratulating one another on the delightful
treat they were enjoying, and on the success
of the great experiment. All hearts were bounding
with joyous excitement, when a disastrous event occurred,
which threw a deep gloom over the scene.
The Duke of Wellington, Sir Robert Peel, and Mr.
Huskisson were among those who were walking on
the railway, when one of the engines was recklessly
put in action, and propelled along the line. There
was a general rush to the carriages, and Mr. Huskisson,
in trying to enter his carriage, slipped backwards
and fell upon the rails. The wheels of the engine
passed over his leg and thigh, and he was so severely injured,
that he expired in a few hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
Notwithstanding this lamentable occurrence, the
journey was continued to Manchester, and the carriages
returned to Liverpool the same evening. On
the following morning the regular trains commenced
running, and they were crowded with passengers,
nothing daunted by the fatal calamity on the opening
day.</p>

<p>The immense advantages of this mode of travelling
were at once apparent, and lines of railway in
different parts of the country were quickly projected.
The railway from London to Birmingham was the first
one commenced after the completion of the Liverpool
and Manchester line, and a connecting link with Manchester
and Liverpool was also begun by a separate
company. The Birmingham Railway was opened
throughout on the 17th September, 1838.</p>

<p>Railway enterprise was not checked by the great
cost of the undertakings, nor by the miscalculations
of the engineers, who, in the first instance, frequently
greatly under-estimated the expenditure requisite for
the cuttings, embankments and tunnels, which were
thought necessary to attain as perfect a level as possible.
The original estimate for the Liverpool and
Manchester Railway was £300,000, but the amount
expended on the works at the time of opening was
nearly £800,000. The original estimate of the London
and Birmingham Railway, including the purchase
of land, and the locomotives and carriages, was
£2,500,000, whilst the actual cost amounted to
£5,600,000, the cost of the works and stations being
about £38,000 per mile. The Grand Junction Railway,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
from Birmingham to Liverpool, was more economically
constructed, because the difficulties to be
surmounted were not so great, and less attention was
paid to maintain a level line. It was estimated to
cost, including all charges, £13,300 per mile, though
the actual cost was £23,200.</p>

<p>The plan adopted for laying down and fixing the
rails on all the railways in England, with the exception
of the Great Western, is nearly similar to that on
which the original coal-pit railways were constructed.
Pieces of timber, called "sleepers," are laid at short
distances across the road, and on to these sleepers are
fixed cast iron "chairs," into which the rails are
fastened by wedges, the sleepers being afterwards
covered with gravel or other similar material, called
"ballast," to make the timbers lie solidly, and to keep
the road dry.</p>

<p>The railway system of Great Britain was commenced
without sufficient attention to the determination
of the best width apart of the rails. In forming
the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, the guage of
the railways in the collieries was adopted, and the
width between the rails was made 4 feet 8½ inches.
The same width of rails was adopted on the London
and Birmingham and Grand Junction Railways; and
as uniformity of guage was essential to enable the
engines and carriages on one line to travel on another,
the other railways connected with the grand trunk
line were made of the same width of guage. Mr.
Brunel, the engineer of the Great Western Railway,
departed from that uniformity, and laid down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
rails 7 feet apart. The increased width of guage possesses
many advantages, of which greater steadiness
of motion and greater attainable speed, without risk,
are the most important; but, at the same time, the
additional space incurs a greater expense in laying
out the line. As branches from the Great Western
Railway spread into the districts where the narrow
guage railways had been laid down, much inconvenience
has arisen from the break of guage, as it occasions
the necessity for a change of carriages. On
some railways, to avoid this inconvenience, narrow
and broad guage rails have been laid down on the
same line.</p>

<p>If the railway system of Great Britain were to be
recommenced, after the experience that has now been
acquired, the medium guage would most probably be
adopted; and in commencing to lay down railways in
Ireland, the Irish Railway Commissioners recommended
6 feet 2 inches as the most desirable width,
and that standard has been advantageously adopted
in the sister country.</p>

<p>Travelling experience tells greatly in favour of the
broad gauge. There is no railway out of London
whereon the carriages run so smoothly, and on which
the passengers are so conveniently accommodated, as
on the Great Western. The speed attained on that
railway also surpasses that on any other. The express
train runs from London to Bristol, a distance of 120
miles, in less than three hours. The author accompanied
an experimental train, when one of the large
engines was first put upon the line, and during some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
portion of the journey a rate of 70 miles an hour was
accomplished without any inconvenient oscillation.</p>

<p>It must be observed, with regard to the action of
locomotive engines, that as the piston-rods are attached
directly to cranks on the axle, each piston makes a
double stroke for every revolution of the driving
wheels; consequently, when the engine is running at
great speed, the movement of the piston is so rapid,
that there is neither time for the free emission of the
waste steam, nor for the full action of the high-pressure
steam admitted. There is, therefore, a great waste of
power occasioned by the admitted steam having to act
against the steam that is escaping; and an engine,
calculated to have the power of 700 horses, will not
exert a tractive force nearly equal to that amount.
With a driving wheel 6 feet in diameter, a locomotive
engine will be propelled 18 feet by each double stroke
of the piston, if there be no slipping on the rails;
consequently, in the space of a mile, the piston must
make 300 double strokes. When running, therefore,
at the speed of 30 miles an hour, the piston makes 150
double strokes per minute.</p>

<p>The success of the great experimental railway from
Manchester to Liverpool not only stimulated similar
works in this country, undertaken by private enterprise;
but the Continental Governments quickly perceived
the importance of that means of communication,
and commenced the formation of railways at the
national cost, and placed them under governmental
control. Belgium was peculiarly adapted, by the
general level state of the country, for the formation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
of railways; and long before any connected system
was completed in this country, the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chemins de fer</i>
formed a complete net-work in that kingdom, and
the system of conducting the traffic was brought to a
much higher state of perfection than was attained in
this country. The rate of travelling, however, was
slower.</p>

<p>It is a question that has been often mooted, whether
it is better to allow the system of communication
throughout the country to be conducted by independent
companies of enterprising individuals, or to place
it entirely under the control of the Government. The
want of system manifested in the formation of the
railways in England has proved a serious inconvenience,
and has occasioned wasteful expenditure,
besides having led to a fearful destruction of life, owing
to the want of careful attention to the means of safety,
and to ill-judged parsimony in the management of the
traffic. There can be no doubt that if the Government
had undertaken the work zealously, and with
the view of establishing a complete system of railway
communication, many of the inconveniences now experienced
might have been avoided, and the railways
might have been laid down and worked at considerably
less cost, and with a large addition to the national
revenue. There is, however, so strong a disinclination
in this country to the centralization of Government
power, and to the extension of Government influence,
that the people generally had rather submit
to considerable inconvenience and expense, than
tolerate the system of railway management which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
has been adopted on the Continent. The necessity
of interference, to protect the interests of the public,
has nevertheless compelled the Government, though
late, to adopt measures for controlling the management
of the railway companies, and stringent regulations
are now imposed with a view to prevent unnecessary
danger to railway passengers.</p>

<p>The railway system of Great Britain, though established
entirely by private enterprise, represents an
amount of capital equal to one-third of the national
debt, and nearly 100,000 individuals are directly employed
in conducting the traffic on the various railways
in this kingdom. An idea of the vastness of
these undertakings, and the important interests involved
in them, may be formed from the following
facts, stated by Mr. Robert Stephenson, at the Institution
of Civil <span class="locked">Engineers:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"The railways of Great Britain and Ireland, completed
at the beginning of 1856, extended 8,054 miles,
and more than enough of single rails were laid to
make a belt round the globe. The cost of constructing
these railways had been £286,000,000. The working
stock comprised 5,000 locomotive engines and 150,000
carriages and trucks; and the coal consumed annually
by the engines amounted to 2,000,000 tons, so
that in every minute 4 tons of coal flashed into steam
20 tons of water. In 1854 there were 111 millions of
passengers conveyed on railways, each passenger
travelling an average of 12 miles. The receipts during
1854 amounted to £20,215,000; and there was
no instance on record in which the receipts of a railway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
had not been of continuous growth, even where
portions of the traffic had been abstracted by new
lines. The wear and tear of the railways was, at the
same time, enormous. For instance, 20,000 tons of
iron rails required to be annually replaced, and 26
millions of wooden sleepers perished in the same time.
To supply this number of sleepers, 300,000 trees were
felled, the growth of which would require little less
than 5,000 acres of forest land. The cost of running
was about fifteen pence per mile, and an average
train will carry 200 passengers. Without railways,
the penny post could not have been established, because
the old mail coaches would have been unable
to carry the mass of letters and newspapers that are
now transmitted. Every Friday night, when the
weekly papers are published, eight or ten carts are
required for Post Office bags on the North-Western
Railway alone, and would hence require 14 or 15
mail coaches."</p>

<p>Adverting to other advantages derived from railway
locomotion, Mr. Stephenson noticed the comparative
safety of that mode of travelling. Railway
accidents occurred to passengers in the first half of
1854 in the proportion of only one accident to every
7,194,343 travellers. As regards the saving of time,
he estimated that on every journey, averaging 12
miles in length, an hour was saved to 111 millions of
passengers per annum, which was equal to 38,000
years, reckoning eight working hours per day; and
allowing each man an average of 3s. a day for his
work, the saving of time might be valued at £2,000,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>000
a year. There were 90,000 persons employed
directly, and 40,000 collaterally, on railways; and
130,000 men, with their families, represent 500,000
so that 1 in 50 of the entire population of the kingdom
might be said to be dependent for their subsistence
on railways.</p>

<p>Every year adds to the extent of the railway system,
and to the increase of the traffic, so that considerable
addition should be made to the amounts
stated by Mr. Stephenson to represent the state of
railway enterprise and railway traffic at the present
day. The traffic returns for the week ending the 25th
of September, 1858, amounted to £502,720; and the
gross receipts of the railways in 1857 were £24,174,610.
The railways now open for traffic in England,
Scotland, and Ireland extended to upwards of 9,000
miles, and the lines reported to be in the course of
construction amount to one-ninth the length of those
completed.</p>

<p>In estimating the importance and advantage of
railway travelling, there must not be omitted its
cheapness and comfort, compared with travelling by
stage coach. There are some persons, indeed, who
look back with regret to the old coaching days; and
it must be admitted that railways have taken away
nearly all the romance of travelling, and much of the
exhilarating pleasure that was experienced when
passing through a beautiful country on the top of a
well-horsed coach in fine weather. The many incidents
and adventures that gave variety to the journey
were pleasant enough for a short distance; but two
days and a night on the top of a coach, exposed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
cold and rain, or cramped up inside, with no room to
stir the body or the legs, was accompanied with an
amount of suffering which those who have experienced
it would willingly exchange for a seat, even in a
third-class railway carriage. In a national and in a
social point of view, also, railways have produced important
improvements. They tend to equalize the
value of land throughout the kingdom, by bringing
distant sources of supply nearer the points of consumption;
they have given extraordinary stimulus
to manufacturing industry; and by connecting all
parts of the country more closely together, railway
communication has concentrated the energies of the
people, and has thus added materially to their wealth,
their comforts, and to social intercourse.</p>

<p>Nor must we, in noticing the grand invention of
locomotion on railways, omit to mention some of the
many subsidiary works which have been created
during its progress towards perfection, and which have
contributed to its success. Tunnels, of a size never
before contemplated, have penetrated for miles through
hard rocks, or through shifting clays and sands; embankments
and viaducts have been raised and erected,
on a scale of magnitude that surpasses any former
similar works; bridges of various novel kinds, invented
and constructed for the special occasions, carry the
railways over straits of the sea, through gigantic tubes;
across rivers, suspended from rods supported by ingeniously
devised piers and girders; and over slanting
roads, on iron beams or on brick arches built askew.
As to the locomotive engines, though the principle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
construction remains the same, the numerous patents
that have been obtained attest that invention has been
active in introducing various improvements in the
details of construction, to facilitate their working, and
to increase their power. The various plans that have
been contrived for improving the structure of the
wheels and axles, for the application of breaks, for
deadening the effect of collisions, for making signals,
for the forms of the rails, and for the modes of fastening
them to the road, are far too many to be enumerated.</p>

<p>In addition to the innumerable contrivances that
have been invented for the improvement of the working
of ordinary railways, several distinct systems of
railway locomotion have been introduced to public
notice, some of which seemed very feasible, though they
have nearly all gradually disappeared. Of these, the
Atmospheric railway was the most promising, and for
a time it bid fair to supersede the use of locomotive
engines. The propulsion of the carriages, by the
pressure of the atmosphere acting on an attached piston
working in a vacuum tube, possessed many theoretical
advantages, and if it could be applied economically,
railway travelling would become more pleasant and
more free from danger than it is. On several lines of
railway the atmospheric plan was put into operation,
but owing to the expense of working, it was gradually
abandoned. The short line from Kingston to Dalky,
in Ireland, up a steep incline, was favourable to the
working of the atmospheric railway, and there it continued
to linger for some time after it had been abandoned
elsewhere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
It is to be regretted that the atmospheric railway
should have failed in economical working, for it possessed
greater advantages for general traffic than the
ordinary locomotive railway trains; and it is probable
that if the same amount of inventive power and industry,
which have been bestowed in improving
locomotive engines, had been directed to overcome
the difficulties of atmospheric traction, it might have
proved economically successful.</p>

<p>The facility of travelling by railway has excited a
spirit of locomotion before undreamed of. Instead of
the diminished demand for horses which was apprehended
when railways displaced stage coaches, public
conveyances have increased a hundredfold. We can
now scarcely conceive the time when there was not
an omnibus in the streets of London, yet, scarcely
more than thirty years ago, they were unknown, and
travelling by stage carriages from one part of the
town to another was prohibited by law! On their
first introduction, omnibuses were considered absurdities,
and were ridiculed as "painted hearses." The
present omnibus traffic in London alone amounts to
nearly £20,000 per week.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_AIR_ENGINE" id="THE_AIR_ENGINE">THE AIR ENGINE.</a></h2>

<p>Numerous attempts have been made to supersede
steam as a motive power, with the view to avoid the
loss of heat by its absorption in the steam in a latent
state. Mercury vapour and spirit vapour have been
tried, in the expectation that as they possess much
less capacity for heat, an equal pressure might be obtained,
with a diminished loss of heating power.
Several gaseous agents have been applied to the same
purpose, of which carbonic acid gas seemed to present
the best prospect of success, because it becomes expanded
with a comparatively small increase of temperature.
None of these attempts to produce a motive
power superior to steam have yet proved successful.
They have all, after a short season of promise, dropped
out of notice; and the only one that is still in the field,
struggling for superiority, is the air engine.</p>

<p>The first known air engine was invented by Sir
George Cayley, in 1803. In his engine the air was
heated by passing directly through the hot coals of the
furnace, which some engineers yet consider to be the
best mode of expansion; but its operation did not answer
expectations. Mr. D. Stirling, of Dundee, afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
improved on Sir George Cayley's plan, and
introduced a method of regaining the heat from the
expanded air, after it had done its work in the cylinder,
and of applying it to expand the air again.
Engines on this construction have been for some years
working in Scotland, and in 1850 Mr. Stirling took out
a patent for an improvement in the arrangement,
which is stated to have been very successful.</p>

<p>Though Sir George Cayley and Mr. Stirling were
the first in the field as inventors of air engines, the
name of Mr. Ericsson, an American, is more closely
associated with the invention, as he has for many years
been conducting experiments on a large scale, and has
tried his "caloric engine" on land, and on a ship of
large burthen, built for the purpose.</p>

<p>The principle and the working of Mr. Ericsson's
caloric engine is nearly the same as Mr. Stirling's;
but as it has been brought most prominently into notice,
we shall direct attention more particularly to its
construction and performances. Mr. Ericsson obtained
a patent for his caloric engine in this country in 1833,
and a subsequent patent for improvements on it was
taken out in 1851. During those years, and to a late
period, he was indefatigably working out the principle,
and numerous highly favourable reports have from
time to time been made of the results of the experiments;
but the advantages to be derived from the
air engine remain nevertheless very questionable.</p>

<p>The object attempted to be gained is to make the
same heating power do its work again and again.
Atmospheric air, after being expanded by passing over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
an extensive hot surface, exerts the force thus acquired
to raise the piston of a large cylinder, and it is then
attempted to abstract the heat as the air issues out, and
to apply it to the expansion of a further quantity.</p>

<p>The practicability of this plan has undergone much
discussion; its friends and foes being equally confident
in their opinions. The former pronounce it to be one
of the most valuable inventions of the age, being calculated
to economize heat, and to give greatly additional
impulse to navigation; whilst its opponents
declare that the calculations are erroneous, the experiments
fallacious, and that the expanded air consumes
more heating power than steam.</p>

<p>In one of the favourable notices of Mr. Ericsson's
engine in an American publication, it is thus described:&mdash;"Two
caloric engines have been constructed in
New York, one of 5-horse power, the other of 60.
The latter has four cylinders; two of 6 feet diameter,
placed side by side, surmounted by two of much
smaller size. Within are pistons, so connected that
those in the lower and upper cylinders move together.
A fire is placed under the bottom of the large cylinders,
called the working cylinders; those above are
called the supply cylinders. As the piston in the
supply cylinder moves down, valves at the top admit
the air. As they rise, those valves close, and the air
passes into a receiver and regenerator, where it is heated
to about 450°, and entering the next working
cylinder, it is further heated by a fire underneath to
485°. The air is thus expanded to double its volume;
and supposing the supply cylinder to be half the size<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
of the other, the air, when expanded, will completely
fill the larger cylinder. As the area of the piston of
the smaller cylinder will be only half that of the
larger, and as the air will be of the same pressure in
both, the total pressure on the piston of the large
cylinder will be double that on the small one. This
surplus furnishes the working power of the engine.
After the air in the working cylinder has forced up
the piston within it, a valve opens; and as the air
passes out, the piston descends by gravity, and cold
air rushes in, and fills the supply cylinder.</p>

<p>"The most striking feature is the regenerator. It
is composed of wire net, placed together to a thickness
of about 12 inches. The side of the regenerator,
near the working cylinder, is heated to a high temperature.
The air passes through it before entering the
working cylinder, and becomes heated to 450°. The
additional heat of 30° is communicated by the fire
underneath to the large cylinder. The expanded air
forces the cylinder upwards, valves open, and it passes
from the cylinder, and again enters the regenerator.
One side of the regenerator is kept cool by the
air on its entering in the opposite direction at each
stroke of the piston; consequently, as the air of the
working cylinder passes out, the wires abstract its
heat so effectually, that when it leaves the regenerator,
it has been robbed of all except about 30°. In
other words, as the air passes into the working cylinder,
it gradually receives from the regenerator about
450° of heat; and as it passes out, this is returned to
the wires, and it is thus used over and over again;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
the only purpose of the fires beneath the cylinders
being to supply the 30° of heat which are lost by
radiation and expansion.</p>

<p>"The regenerator in the 60-horse engine measures
26 inches in height and width. Each disc of wire
composing it contains 676 superficial square inches,
and the net has 10 meshes to the inch. Each superficial
inch, therefore, contains 100 meshes, and there
are 67,600 in each disc; and as 200 discs are employed,
the regenerator contains 13,520,000 meshes,
with an equal number of small spaces between the
discs as there are meshes; therefore, the air is distributed
into 27,000,000 of minute cells. The wire in
each disc is 1,140 feet long; and the total length of
wire in the regenerator is 41½ miles, or equal to the
surface of four steam boilers, each 40 feet long and 4
feet diameter."</p>

<p>The accounts received from America of the great
success that had attended the working of Mr.
Ericsson's air engine, on the ship "Ericsson," attracted
much attention in this country, and formed the
subject of two evenings' discussion in the Institution
of Civil Engineers. The most prevalent opinion was,
that it is impossible to regain the heating power
without corresponding loss of mechanical force or the
addition of heat, and that there must have been some
fallacy in the reports of the work done and of the
quantity of fuel consumed.</p>

<p>It is, indeed, evident that nothing approaching
the amount of heat said to have been recovered could
be regained by passing through the regenerator; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
as the apparatus becomes heated by the first portions
of air passing through it, the temperature of the quantity
that afterwards passed must at least be equal to
that of the heated wires, and the last portions of air
would consequently scarcely part with any caloric to
the regenerator, previously heated to nearly its own
temperature. Experience has since proved that the
notion of regaining the heat by the regenerator was
fallacious, for in the last improvements in Mr.
Ericsson's engine, it is stated that the regenerator has
been abandoned, and the plan has been adopted of
cooling the air as it issues from the large cylinder,
by passing it through tubes surrounded by cold
water, and then using the same air over again.</p>

<p>One great practical inconvenience in the use of
the air engine was the necessity of having enormously
large cylinders to attain the required power, with the
low amount of pressure that can be procured by the
expansion of the air. The consequent friction increased
the loss of power, and the difficulty of lubricating
the pistons added to the practical objections to
the air engine. To overcome these objections, the
air in Mr. Stirling's engine is compressed before it is
heated, by which means an equal amount of pressure
is obtained on a smaller piston.</p>

<p>The air engine would in many respects possess
advantages over the steam engine, if it could be
worked economically. The space occupied by the
boilers would be saved, and the danger of explosions
would be avoided; for hot air does not scald, and the
quantity at any time expanded would be too small to
do much injury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
A patent has since been obtained by Messrs.
Napier and Rankine, for improvements in the air
engine, which they anticipated would remove the objections
that have been raised to the engines of Stirling
and Ericsson. The heating surface has been
greatly increased by employing tubes; and other defects
in the former engines, to which their want of
complete success is attributed, have been remedied,
so that Mr. Rankine, in his description of the improvements
at the meeting of the British Association
at Liverpool, confidently anticipated to effect a great
saving of heating power, combined with the other advantages
of the air engine. He estimated the consumption
of fuel by a theoretically perfect air engine
on Mr. Stirling's principle at 0·37 lbs. per horse
power per hour; whilst a theoretically perfect steam
engine would consume 1·86 lbs. The actual average
consumption of a steam engine is, however, 4 lbs. of
fuel per horse power per hour, and the actual consumption
of Stirling's engine is stated by Mr. Rankine
to have been 2·20 lbs, and that of Ericsson's 2·80
lbs. It appears from this statement, therefore, that
the air engines of Messrs. Stirling and Ericsson are
superior in point of economy of fuel to steam engines;
and if Mr. Rankine's anticipations of the superiority
of his air engine be realized, it will effect still greater
economy. In Messrs. Napier and Rankine's engine,
the air is compressed before expansion, so that the
size of the cylinders may be reduced to even smaller
dimensions than the cylinders of steam engines of
equal power.</p>

<h2><a name="PHOTOGRAPHY" id="PHOTOGRAPHY">PHOTOGRAPHY.</a></h2>

<p>The power we now possess of fixing the transient
impression of the rays of light, and of retaining the
beautiful images of the camera obscura, is perhaps
the most astonishing of the present age of wonders.
Effects similar to those of the electric telegraph, of
steam navigation, of dissolving views, and of other
wondrous realizations of inventive genius, had been
anticipated in growing tales of Eastern romance
centuries ago; but the most fanciful imagination had
not conceived the possibility of making Nature her
own artist, and of producing, in the twinkling of an
eye, a permanent representation of all the objects
comprehended within the range of vision.</p>

<p>Such an idea could scarcely have occurred until
after the invention of the camera obscura; but when
looking at the beautiful pictures focused on the screen
of that instrument, it became an object of longing
desire to fix them there.</p>

<p>To trace the history of Photography from its earliest
beginnings, we must go back to the days of the
alchemists, who were the discoverers of the influence
of light in darkening the salts of silver, on which all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
photographic processes on paper depend. That property
of light was noticed in 1566, and it induced the
speculative philosophers of that day to conceive that
luminous rays contained a sulphurous principle which
transmitted the forms of matter. Homberg, more
than a century afterwards, misled by this action of
the sun's rays, supposed that they insinuated themselves
into the particles of bodies, and increased their
weight; and Sir Isaac Newton also entertained a
similar opinion.</p>

<p>The influence of the solar rays in facilitating the
crystallization of saltpetre and sal ammoniac, was
shown by Petit in 1722; and in 1777, the distinguished
chemist Scheele discovered that the violet
rays of the spectrum possess greater power in producing
those changes than any other. A solution of
nitrate of silver, then called "the acid of silver," was
known to be peculiarly susceptible to the action of
those rays. The experiment by which it was illustrated
consisted in pouring the solution on chalk,
which became blackened by exposure to light.
These discoveries were made by Scheele in his endeavours
to find in light the source of "phlogiston"&mdash;that
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ignis fatuus</i> of the chemists of the last century.
We thus perceive, in the first steps towards the
invention of Photography, one of the many instances
of the discovery of truth in the search after error.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the present century, Mr.
Wedgwood, the celebrated porcelain manufacturer,
undertook a series of experiments to fix the images of
the camera, assisted by Mr. (afterwards Sir Humphry)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
Davy. They so far succeeded as to impress the
images on the screen, but unfortunately they had not
the power of preserving the paper from being blackened
all over when exposed for a short time to the
light. "Nothing," said Sir Humphry Davy, in his
account of these experiments, "but a method of preventing
the unshaded parts of the delineation from
being coloured by exposure to light is wanting to
render this process as useful as it is elegant."</p>

<p>It was in June, 1802, that Mr. T. Wedgwood published
"an account of a method of copying paintings
on glass, and of making profiles by the agency of
light; with observations by H. Davy." Mr. Wedgwood
made use of white paper or white leather, moistened
with a solution of nitrate of silver. The following
description of the process, contributed to the
"Journals of the Royal Institution" by Davy, will be
read with interest, as showing how closely these experiments
approximated to the photogenic process,
invented by Mr. Talbot thirty-six years <span class="locked">afterwards:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"White paper or white leather moistened with a
solution of nitrate of silver undergoes no change in a
dark place; but on being exposed to daylight, it
speedily changes colour, and after passing through
different shades of grey and brown, becomes at length
nearly black; the alterations of colour take place
more speedily in proportion as the light is more intense.
In the direct rays of the sun, two or three
minutes are sufficient to produce the full effect. In
the shade, several hours are required; and light transmitted
through different coloured glasses acts on it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
with different degrees of intensity. Thus it is found
that red rays, or the common sunbeams passed
through red glass, have very little action on it. Yellow
or green are more efficacious; but blue and violet
light produce the most decided and powerful effects.</p>

<p>"When the shadow of any figure is thrown on the
prepared surfaced, the part concealed by it remains
white, and the other parts speedily become dark.
For copying paintings on glass, the solution should be
applied on leather, and in this case it is more readily
acted on than when paper is used. When the colour
has been once fixed on leather or paper, it cannot be
removed by the application of water, or water and
soap, and it is in a high degree permanent. The
copy of a painting or a profile, immediately after being
taken, must be kept in a dark place. It may,
indeed, be examined in the shade, but in this case the
exposure should only be for a few minutes; by the
light of candles or lamps, it is not sensibly affected.
No attempts that have been made to prevent the uncoloured
parts of the copy or profile from being acted
upon by light, have as yet been successful. They
have been covered with a coating of fine varnish, but
this has not destroyed their susceptibility of becoming
coloured; and even after repeated washings, sufficient
of the active part of the saline matter will still adhere
to the white parts of the leather or paper, to cause
them to become dark when exposed to the rays of
the sun.</p>

<p>"The woody fibres of leaves, and the wings of insects,
may be pretty accurately copied; and in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
case it is only necessary to cause the direct solar
light to pass through them, and to receive the shadows
on prepared leather. Images formed by means of
the camera obscura have been found too faint to produce,
in any moderate time, an effect on nitrate of
silver. To copy those images was the first object of
Mr. Wedgwood in his researches on this subject, and
for this purpose he first used the nitrate of silver,
which was mentioned to him by a friend as a substance
very sensible to the influence of light; but all
his numerous experiments, as to their primary end,
proved unsuccessful."</p>

<p>It will be seen, from the foregoing account of the
results of their experiments, that Mr. Wedgwood's
process and the early processes of Mr. Talbot were
nearly alike; and if he had possessed the means which
the compound salt hyposulphite of soda afforded to
subsequent photographers, of destroying the sensibility
of the prepared paper to further impressions of the
rays of light, there can be little doubt that the invention
would have attained a high degree of perfection
at the commencement of the present century. As it
was, the failure of Mr. Wedgwood to accomplish the
object he was so nearly attaining appears to have
discouraged attempts by others, and twenty years
elapsed without any advance having been made towards
its realization.</p>

<p>M. Niepce, of Chalons on the Saone, who was the
first to succeed in obtaining permanent representations
of the images of the camera, commenced experimenting
on the subject in 1814, at least ten years before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
M. Daguerre directed his attention to Photography.
In 1826 these two gentlemen became acquainted, and
conjointly prosecuted the investigations which led to
the beautiful result of the Daguerreotype. M. Niepce
having previously succeeded in obtaining durable
representations of the pictures focused in the camera,
he came to this country in 1827, and exhibited several
of the results of his process, and communicated to the
Royal Society an account of his experiments. These
photographs, which may be considered the first durable
ones that had been obtained, were, with one
exception, taken on plates made of pewter. One of
the largest was 5¼ inches long and 4 inches wide. It
was taken from a print 2½ feet in length, representing
the ruins of an abbey. When seen in a proper light,
the impression appeared very distinct. Another one,
which was stated to have been the first successful attempt,
was a view taken from nature, representing a
court-yard. Its size was 7½ inches by 6 inches, but it
was not so distinct as the preceding one. A third
specimen was an impression on paper, <i>printed from
a photograph on metal</i>, the picture having been etched
into the plate by nitric acid, and then printed from.
All these specimens, though extremely curious as the
first successful attempts to preserve the images of the
camera, were more or less imperfect, and were far
from presenting the beautiful results of Photography
now attained. It is remarkable, however, that the
original process of etching the picture on a metal
plate, and printing from it, has now, in the perfected
state of the art, become the most recent improvement;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
and the prints from photographic plates present some
of the most beautiful effects hitherto <span class="locked">produced.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></span></p>

<p>M. Niepce communicated the particulars of his
process to M. Daguerre in December, 1829. They
then entered into an agreement to pursue their investigations
jointly, but it was not until ten years afterwards
that the invention of the Daguerreotype by
M. Daguerre was made known. To M. Niepce must,
therefore, be awarded the honour of having first discovered
the means of rendering permanent the transient
images of the camera obscura. The plan he
adopted was to cover a plate of white metal with
asphalte varnish, and expose it to the action of light
in a camera, when the parts whereon the light was
concentrated became hardened, and the other parts
remained unaltered, and could be washed away.</p>

<p>In M. Niepce's account of the process, after describing
the preparation of the asphalte varnish, he
says:&mdash;"A tablet of <i>plated silver</i>, or well-cleaned and
warm <i>glass</i>, is to be highly polished, on which a thin
coating of varnish is to be applied cold, with a light
roll of very soft skin. This will impart to it a fine
vermilion colour, and cover it with a very thin and
equal coating. The plate is then placed on heated
iron, which is wrapped round with several folds of
paper, from which, by this method, all moisture has
been previously expelled. When the varnish has
ceased to simmer, the plate is withdrawn from the heat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>and left to cool and dry in a gentle temperature, and
protected from a damp atmosphere. The plate, thus
prepared, may be immediately subjected to the action
of the luminous fluid in the focus of the camera; but
even after having been thus exposed a length of time
sufficient for receiving the impressions of external objects,
nothing is apparent to show that these impressions
exist. The forms of the future picture remain
still invisible. The next operation then is to disengage
the shrouded image, and this is accomplished by a
solvent."</p>

<p>The solvent employed was a mixture of one part
of oil of lavender, and ten parts of oil of petroleum.
The solvent was poured over the plate, and allowed
to remain. M. Niepce continues: "The operator,
observing it by reflected light, begins to perceive the
images of the objects to which it has been exposed
gradually unfolding their forms, though still veiled by
the supernatant fluid, continually becoming darker
from saturation with the varnish."</p>

<p>The time required for the exposure of the plates in
the camera was six or eight hours. For the purpose
of darkening the pictures, M. Niepce used iodine, and
it has been supposed that the use of iodine for that
purpose suggested the employment of it to his partner.</p>

<p>The process adopted by M. Daguerre was, to deposit
a film of iodine on a highly polished silver plate,
by exposing the plate to the vapour of iodine in a dark
box. The prepared plate was then placed in the
camera, and after an exposure of ten minutes or more,
according to the brightness of the day, an impression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
was made on the iodised silver, but too faint to be
visible. To bring out the image thus invisibly impressed,
the plate was exposed to the vapour of mercury,
in a closed box. The mercury adhered to the
parts on which the light had acted, and left the other
parts of the plate untouched; and by this means a
beautiful representation was produced, in which the
deposited mercury represented the lights of the picture,
and the polished silver the shadows. The iodised
silver remaining on the plate not acted on by light,
was washed away by a solution of hyposulphite of
soda, and the picture could then be exposed without
injury.</p>

<p>Nothing can exceed the delicacy of delineation by
such a Daguerreotype; for the fine surface of the
highly polished silver seems to exhibit the impressions
of the smallest objects that emit rays of light. The
length of time required to produce an impression was,
however, a serious obstacle to the use of the process,
as originally invented, for taking portraits. Numerous
attempts were consequently made to obtain a more
sensitive material. Bromine was tried, in addition to
iodine, and with such complete success, that a few
seconds were sufficient to effect an impression on the
plate, which could be forcibly brought out by the vapour
of mercury.</p>

<p>It was in 1840 that portraits were first taken by
the Daguerreotype process in this country. In the
first instance, a concave mirror was employed to concentrate
the rays of light on the plate, instead of a
lens; and the author has now in his possession a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
portrait taken in this manner, by "Wolcott's reflecting
apparatus." The object of using a concave mirror
was to be able to concentrate a greater number of the
rays of light than could be done by a lens, and thus
to form a brighter image. At the time that portrait
was taken, the means had not been discovered of
making the mercury adhere to the plate, and a feather
would brush it away. Soon afterwards, however, M.
Fizeau ingeniously contrived to fix the images on the
plate by gilding it. This was done by pouring on to
the plate a few drops of a diluted solution of muriate
of gold, and holding it horizontally over the flame of
a spirit lamp; by which means the gold was deposited
and formed a thin, beautiful film of the metal over the
surface, and thus not only made the picture more durable,
but gave it increased effect.</p>

<p>The French government, fully appreciating the
importance of the invention, determined to purchase
it from the patentee, and to throw it open to the public.
An account of the invention was published in
June, 1839; and in the following month an arrangement
was entered into, to the effect that, in consideration
of M. Daguerre making the process fully known,
a pension of 6,000 francs should be granted to him for
life, and a pension of 4,000 francs to M. Isidore
Niepce, the nephew of the original inventor of Photography,
his uncle having died before the final success
was attained.</p>

<p>It was generally supposed at the time, that by the
grant of those pensions the invention was thrown open
to the whole world, as represented by the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
Minister; but, nevertheless, M. Daguerre patented
the process in other countries, and France alone reaped
the benefit of a free use of the invention.</p>

<p>Whilst M. Daguerre was thus successfully working
out to perfection the plan of producing beautiful naturally-impressed
pictures on iodised silver surfaces,
Mr. Fox Talbot was at the same time nearly attaining
the same results. The following is the account given
by himself of his <span class="locked">researches:<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></span>&mdash;"Having in the year
1834 discovered the principles of Photography on
paper, I some time afterwards made some experiments
on metal plates; and in 1838 I discovered a method
of rendering a silver plate sensitive to light, by exposing
it to iodine vapours. I was at that time, therefore,
treading in the footsteps of M. Daguerre, without
knowing that he, or indeed any other person, was
pursuing, or had commenced or thought of, the art
which we now call Photography. But as I was not
aware of the power of mercurial vapour to bring
out the latent impressions, I found my plates of iodised
silver deficient in sensibility, and therefore continued
to use in preference my photogenic drawing
paper. This was in 1838. Some time after&mdash;in
August, 1839&mdash;M. Daguerre published an account of
his perfected process, which reached us during the
meeting of the British Association; and I took the
opportunity to lay before the Section the facts which
I had myself ascertained in Metallic Photography."</p>

<p>Whilst to M. Daguerre must be awarded the honour
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>of having first brought to perfection the method
of rendering permanent the images of the camera on
metal plates, Mr. Fox Talbot may claim to be the
first who perfected similar images on paper, which the
comparative roughness of the surface alone prevented
from being as delicately beautiful as the pictures of
the Daguerreotype. He commenced his experiments
in Photography in 1834; and on the 31st of January,
1839, he read a paper before the Royal Society, entitled,
"Some Account of the Art of Photogenic
Drawing; or, a process by which natural objects may
be made to delineate themselves without the aid of the
artist's pencil."</p>

<p>Mr. Talbot had not then succeeded in obtaining
the impressions of images focused in the camera; what
he had succeeded in doing was to fix upon paper the
shadows of objects placed upon it, and exposed to the
light of the sun. The paper was first dipped into a
solution of common salt, and then wiped dry, to
diffuse the salt uniformly through the substance of the
paper. A solution of nitrate of silver was then spread
over one surface with a soft brush, and dried carefully
before a fire in a darkened room. The strength of the
solution was regulated by first obtaining a saturated
solution of the nitrate of silver, and afterwards diluting
it with six or eight times its volume of water. The
objects to be copied, such as leaves, lace, or other flat
surfaces, were pressed against the prepared paper by
a glass fixed in a frame, and exposure to light quickly
darkened all the parts of the paper, excepting those
shaded by the objects. The image thus impressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
was what is termed a "negative," the dark parts
which excluded the light being left white on the
paper, and the parts through which the light passed
being darkened. To produce a picture corresponding
with the natural lights and shades, the process was
repeated, substituting the picture first obtained, on
thin transparent paper, for the original object, by
which means the lights and shadows were reversed.</p>

<p>The chloride of silver, formed on the surface of
the sensitive paper by the combination of the common
salt and nitrate of silver, being insoluble in water,
great difficulty was experienced in washing it away,
so as to prevent the whole surface from afterwards
darkening on exposure to light. The application of
hyposulphite of soda, for the purpose of making the
pictures durable, was suggested by Sir John Herschel,
and it answers remarkably well, as it dissolves the chloride
of silver. A solution of ammonia is nearly
equally efficacious in removing the chloride.</p>

<p>The Calotype process, by which the images of the
camera can be fixed upon paper, was invented by Mr.
Talbot, in 1840. It is thus described:&mdash;Dissolve 100
grains of crystallized nitrate of silver in 6 ounces of
distilled water. Procure some fine writing paper, and
wash one side of it with the solution, laid on with a
soft brush; then dry the paper cautiously, by holding
it at a distance from the fire. When dry, dip the
paper into a solution of iodide of potassium, containing
500 grains dissolved in 1 pint of water, and let it remain
in the solution two or three minutes. Then dip
it into a vessel of water; remove the water on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
surface by blotting paper, and dry it by a fire, in the
dark or by candle-light. The paper thus prepared is
called "iodised paper;" it is not very sensitive to
light, and may be kept for some time without spoiling.
Next dissolve 100 grains of crystallized nitrate of silver
in 2 ounces of distilled water; add to the solution
one-sixth of its volume of strong acetic acid, and call
that mixture A. Then make a strong solution of
crystallized gallic acid in cold water, and let that solution
be called B. Mix equal volumes of A and B
together in small quantities at a time. That mixture
Mr. Talbot calls gallo-nitrate of silver, and with it
wash over the surface of the iodised paper. Allow
the paper to remain half a minute, and then dip it into
water, and again dry it lightly with blotting paper.
The paper thus prepared is very sensitive, and will
receive an impression in the camera in the shortest
possible time. The impression is at first invisible,
but it may be brought out by laying the paper aside
in the dark, or by washing it once more in the gallo-nitrate
of silver, and holding it at a short distance from
the fire. To fix the picture, the paper is first washed
in water and lightly dried, and then soaked in a solution
of hyposulphite of soda for a few minutes, by
which means the iodised silver is removed, and after
being again washed in water and dried, the process is
completed. The picture thus produced is a negative
one, and requires to be transferred in the manner
before stated. The original Calotype may, by that
means, serve to produce a great number of pictures.</p>

<p>Mr. Talbot's patent was sealed on the 8th of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
February, 1841. In his specification, he claimed the
use of gallic acid, and he succeeded in enforcing his
claim in a Court of Law, though it appeared that on
the 10th of April, 1839, photographs of objects taken
in the solar microscope in five minutes, by the Rev.
J.&nbsp;B. Reade, were shown at the London institution,
which were described to have been produced by an
infusion of galls, and fixed with hyposulphite of
soda. It must be mentioned, however, to Mr. Talbot's
honour, that on a representation to him by
the President of the Royal Society that the art of
Photography was impeded in its progress in this
country by patent monopolies, he generously made a
present to the public of all his inventions and discoveries,
reserving to himself only the privilege of
taking portraits.</p>

<p>The transfer from one paper to another of the
picture obtained in the camera, and the comparative
roughness of the surface of the paper itself,
prevent Calotypes from exhibiting that sharpness
and delicacy of definition which are so admirable in
a Daguerreotype. Several attempts were therefore
made to obtain a more smooth surface for the reception
of the image; but without much success,
until glass was adopted for the purpose. To make
that material available, it is necessary to coat it with
some substance that will absorb the sensitive solution.
In the first instance, the white of eggs was
employed with considerable success. Albumen has,
however, been supplanted by collodion&mdash;a solution
of gun-cotton in ether&mdash;which is found to be peculiarly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
suitable for the reception of the sensitive
preparation of silver.</p>

<p>In conducting the collodion process, the collodion
is first iodised by adding to it iodide of potassium
and iodide of silver, dissolved in alcohol. The iodised
collodion is then poured over a plate of glass that
has been carefully cleaned, and is moved about horizontally
until a perfectly uniform film is spread over
the surface, to which it adheres firmly. The plate is
afterwards dipped into a solution of nitrate of silver,
which renders it so highly sensitive to impressions
of light, that it will receive an image in less than
a second. The image is latent, until it is developed
by pouring over the plate a mixture of pyro-gallic
acid in distilled water, acetic acid, and nitrate of
silver. The impression is fixed with hyposulphite of
soda.</p>

<p>The pictures produced by the collodion process
are negatives, which serve admirably for transferring
positive pictures on to sensitive paper. But, if required,
the negative picture can be readily changed
into a positive one, by converting the darkened silver
into white metallic silver, by a mixture of protosulphate
of iron and pyro-gallic acid. In a short
time a white metallic image is obtained, which, when
relieved by a background of black velvet or black
varnish, equals in delicacy of finish the most beautiful
Daguerreotypes.</p>

<p>Many attempts have been made, but hitherto
without success, to obtain photographs coloured, as
well as shaded, by nature. The opinions of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
who have most studied the subject differ as to the
possibility of ever attaining that desired object. Sir
John Herschel has so far shown that it is not impossible,
as to have impressed the colours of the solar
spectrum on paper, by the mere action of light; and
parts of the images of objects fixed on the screen of
the camera are also sometimes coloured. These facts
induce us to hope that in the progress of discovery
some means may be found of obtaining naturally-coloured
photographs, notwithstanding it has been
pronounced, by good authorities, to be an absolute
impossibility.</p>

<p>Specimens of coloured photographs were exhibited
by Mr. Mercer at the recent meeting of the
British Association, which showed that by the use of
various chemical preparations that are sensitive to
light, photographs may be shaded in colours. The
principal re-agents employed were salts of iron, and
by immersing the paper in suitable menstrua, after
the image had been impressed in the camera, the
picture was developed in any colour required; the
same tint being spread over the whole. One purpose
to which it was suggested this coloured photographic
process is applicable, is printing on woven
fabrics, the action of light serving as a mordant to
fix the colours.</p>

<p>Photography has been already applied to various
uses, and it is capable of being rendered much more
valuable. To the meteorologist it affords the means
of registering the rise and fall of the mercury in the
barometer and thermometer, and, by a self-registering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
apparatus, the changes of temperature and of atmospheric
pressure are marked upon paper that records
the time at which the changes occur. It may also be
applied, in the same manner, to register the directions
of the wind, and the times of its changes. The
sun impresses his own image upon paper; and the
spots on his surface, thus correctly delineated, can
be compared with those seen in pictures of the sun
at other times; and the foundation is laid for more
correct knowledge of the nature of those appearances,
and of the motion of the sun himself. Photographs
of the moon and planets present exact representations
of those heavenly bodies, as seen through
the most powerful telescope; and, with the assistance
of the stereoscope, the figure of the moon is shown in
its true globular form, as it can be seen by no other
means. It has been proposed, indeed, by the aid of
Photography, to extend our knowledge of the stars
far beyond the reach of telescopic vision; for as the
image focused on the screen of the camera is composed
of rays from every object on the body of a star,
it might be possible to see those objects by greatly
magnifying the image. It remains, however, for the
further progress of discovery and invention, to arrive
at so delicate a delineation by photographic processes,
as to obtain landscapes of the moon, and portraits of
the inhabitants of Jupiter!</p>

<p>One of the latest advances in the art of Photography
has been the engraving on steel-plates by the
action of light, by which means more forcible effects
have been obtained than by the impressions of light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
upon paper. Mr. Fox Talbot has distinguished himself
in thus fixing the images on steel, as he was the
first to impress them upon paper. In his method of
doing so, he covers the steel plate with a solution of
isinglass and bichromate of potass, and placing a collodion
negative picture upon it, he exposes it to the
action of light. When the picture is sufficiently impressed,
he etches it into the plate by means of bichloride
of platinum. M. Niepce, the nephew of the
original inventor of Photography, has produced the
same effect by reviving the first processes adopted by
his uncle; using, as he did, bitumen, dissolved in essential
oil of lavender, to cover the plates. Two
other foreign photographers, M. Poitevin and M.
Pretschi, have also successfully directed their attention
to engraving the images of the camera, which
has now obtained a high degree of perfection.</p>

<p>It is well worth notice that these most recent improvements
in Photography are but further developments
of the original designs of M. Niepce, who not
only succeeded in etching the pictures impressed by
the light of the sun on his metal tablets, but made
use of a glass surface, on which the now generally
adopted collodion process depends.</p>

<h2><a name="DISSOLVING_VIEWS" id="DISSOLVING_VIEWS">DISSOLVING VIEWS.</a></h2>

<p>There are no optical illusions more extraordinary
than those shown in the exhibition of Dissolving
Views. The effects of the changes in the diorama are
only such as are seen in nature, the same scene being
represented under different circumstances, and the
marvel in that case is that such beautiful and natural
effects can be produced on the same canvas. But
Dissolving Views set nature at defiance, and exhibit
metamorphoses as great as can be conceived by the
wildest fancy.</p>

<p>Whilst, for instance, the spectator is looking at the
interior of a church, he sees the objects gradually
assuming different appearances. The columns that
support the vaulted roof begin to fade away, and their
places are occupied by other forms, which gradually
become better defined and stronger, and a tree, a
house, or, it may be, a rock, thrusts the columns out
of view, and the roof dims into blue sky, chequered
with clouds. The original view thus entirely disappears,
and the scene is changed from the interior of
a church to open country, or to a rocky valley. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
is done, not by changing at once one scene into
another, but by substituting different individual objects,
which at first appear like faint shadows, and
then, becoming more and more vivid, at length altogether
supplant their predecessors on the field of
view, and will, in their turn, be extinguished by others.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens that some strongly marked
object resists apparently the efforts made to dispossess
it, and in the midst of a mountainous scene will be
observed the form of a chandelier or of a statue, that
occupied a distinguished place in the church that has
just vanished. In a short time, however, these relics
disappear, and the mountain, the valley, and the lake
are freed from the incongruous images of the former
scene.</p>

<div id="ip_87" class="figcenter" style="width: 339px;"><img src="images/i_b_088.jpg" width="339" height="336" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>These effects are produced in a manner as simple
as they are extraordinary. All that is requisite is to
have two magic lanterns fitted on to a stand, with
their tubes inclined towards each other, so that both
discs of light may exactly coincide, and form on the
screen a single disc. If paintings on glass, representing
different views, be then placed in each lantern,
with the lenses adjusted to bring the rays to a focus
on the screen, the two images will be so mingled together
as to present only a confused mixture of colours.
Suppose one of the views to be the interior of a church,
and the other to be a mountain scene;&mdash;the pillars of
the church will be mingled with trees and rocks, and
in the midst of the confusion there may perhaps be
discerned a strongly painted chandelier or an altar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>piece. When an opaque shade is placed before the
lens of either of the lanterns, to prevent the light
from reaching the screen, the previous confusion becomes
instantly clear and distinct, and the church or
the landscape is seen without any interfering images.
If the opaque screen be gradually withdrawn from
one lens, and at the same time drawn in an equal degree
over the other, the different objects will again
be mingled, and those in the one scene will predominate
over those in the other in proportion to the relative
quantities of light permitted to issue from each
lantern to the screen. The two first of the accompanying
drawings are thus blended together in the
third, when the screen is half withdrawn from each.</p>

<div id="ip_89" class="figcenter" style="width: 337px;"><img src="images/i_b_089.jpg" width="337" height="332" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
It is usual to fix the opaque shade, which alternately
covers and exposes the two magic lanterns, on
to a central pin, so that it may be moved vertically
up or down. The shade is so arranged, that in raising
the end to cover the lens of one lantern, the farther
end descends, and exposes, in an equal degree,
the other lens. During the time that either of the
views is altogether concealed, the painting is changed;
and in this manner an unlimited number of metamorphoses
may be effected.</p>

<p>It requires no expensive apparatus to show the
effect of Dissolving Views on a small scale. Two
common magic lanterns are quite sufficient for the
purpose of private exhibition, and the angle at which
they should be fixed on their stand may be readily
ascertained after a few trials. To make the transformation
more extraordinary, a man's face may be
painted on one glass and a landscape on the other;
and, when the change is made from the face to the
landscape, a strongly painted eye or nose may be seen
occupying the centre of the view, long after the other
features have disappeared, until all the rays of light
from that painting have been excluded. The change
from youth to age, from beauty to ugliness, may also
be shown with striking effect.</p>

<p>It will be observed that the principle, on which
the metamorphoses of Dissolving Views depend, is
similar to that which produces the variations in the
diorama. In both cases there are two paintings on
the same space, either of which may be shown at
pleasure by different dispositions of the light; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
chief difference between them being that the Dissolving
Views are seen altogether by reflected light,
whilst in the diorama the paintings at the back and
front are shown alternately by reflected and by transmitted
light.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_KALEIDOSCOPE" id="THE_KALEIDOSCOPE">THE KALEIDOSCOPE.</a></h2>

<p>No invention, on being first brought out, created
so general a sensation as the Kaleidoscope. Every
person, who could buy or make one, had a Kaleidoscope.
Men, women, and children&mdash;rich and poor;
in houses or walking in the streets; in carriages, or
on coaches&mdash;were to be seen looking into the wonder-working
tube, admiring the beautiful patterns it produced,
and the magical changes which the least
movement of the glass occasioned.</p>

<p>It was in the year 1814 that Sir David Brewster
discovered the principle on which the effects of the
Kaleidoscope depend, whilst he was engaged in experiments
on the polarization of light by successive
reflections between plates of glass. The reflectors
were in some cases inclined to each other, and he
remarked the circular arrangement of the images of a
candle round a centre. In afterwards repeating the
experiments of M. Biot on the action of fluids on
light, he placed the fluids in a trough formed by two
plates of glass cemented together at an angle. The
eye being placed at one end, some of the cement
which pressed through between the plates appeared to
be arranged in a circular figure. The symmetry of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
this figure being very remarkable, Sir David Brewster
undertook to investigate the cause of the phenomenon,
and the result of his investigations was the invention
of the instrument to which he gave the name of
Kaleidoscope, from the Greek words καλος {kalos}, beautiful,
ειδος {eidos}, a form, and σκοπεω {skopeô}, to <span class="locked">see.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></span></p>

<p>The Kaleidoscope in its simplest form consists of
two equal strips of plate glass, about 8 inches long
and 2 inches wide, silvered on one side, to act as reflectors.
These glasses are placed one over the other
exactly, and then the edges on one side being
separated, whilst the two other edges are kept close
together, they are fixed by means of separating pieces
of wood and string at the angle required. The glasses
are then fitted into a metal tube, which has an eye-hole
at one end, and at the other end of the tube there
is fixed a small cell of ground glass, to contain pieces
of differently stained glass or other objects, that are
to be multiplied by reflections into beautiful
symmetrical figures. In the better kind of Kaleidoscopes,
the cell containing the objects may be turned
round, by which means the pieces of glass shift their
positions, and the figures instantly change. The same
effect is produced, though in a less agreeable manner,
in the common kind of instruments, by turning the
tube.</p>

<p>To form by the combined reflections from the two
glasses a perfectly symmetrical figure, the sector comprised
between the inclined sides of the glasses may
consist of any even aliquot part of a circle. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>the accompanying diagram, the ends of the flat
silvered glasses <i>a c</i>,
<i>b c</i>, are inclined at an
angle of 60 degrees;
therefore the circle
is completed by the
junction of six sectors.
In such a Kaleidoscope,
the circular
figure will be
formed by three reflections
from each
glass.</p>

<div id="ip_94" class="figcenter" style="width: 252px;"><img src="images/i_b_094.jpg" width="252" height="250" alt="" /><br /></div>

<div id="ip_94b" class="figcenter" style="width: 246px;"><img src="images/i_b_094b.jpg" width="246" height="243" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>To make the formation of the circular figure
by repeated reflections more intelligible, we will
consider it as composed of the smallest possible
number of equal divisions,
as in the
second diagram, in
which the circle is
divided into quadrants.
In such an
arrangement of the
reflectors, the figure
seen on looking
through the central
aperture will consist
of four parts. In the
first place, the objects included in the space <i>a b c</i>,
between the inclined glasses, will be seen directly by
rays of light from the objects themselves; viz., the
small cross <i>d</i>, and the triangle <i>e</i>. The same field of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
view will be reflected from both mirrors, by which
reflection the cross on one side will seem to be
doubled, and the triangle on the other will have
another similar one added to it, to make a complete
rhomb. The cross will also be reflected by the mirror
on the right side, and the triangle by the one on the
left. The images of the objects contained within the
space <i>a b c</i>, being thus presented by reflection on both
sides, they become the objects for further reflections
from parts of the mirrors still nearer the spectator.
Thus the images <i>d</i><span class="fnanchor">1</span> on both sides are reflected to form
the single image <i>d</i><span class="fnanchor">2</span>, and the images <i>e</i><span class="fnanchor">1</span> are in the same
manner reflected to form the second image <i>e</i><span class="fnanchor">2</span>.</p>

<p>When the angle formed by the inclination of the
mirrors divides the circle into a greater number of
sectors, the reflections of the images are repeated,
from points nearer and nearer to the eye, and the
circle is thus completed, however numerous the sectors
may be; but at each repetition of the reflection,
the images will become more dim, since, owing to
the imperfection of reflecting surfaces, a portion of
the light is absorbed at each reflection.</p>

<p>In the first instruments that were constructed, the
objects were fixed in the field of view, therefore
scarcely any change of pattern was obtainable. It
was not until some time afterwards that the idea occurred
to Sir David Brewster of producing endless
changes of the figures, by making the objects movable
in a cell of glass at the end of the instrument.
He afterwards introduced other improvements in the
Kaleidoscope, for extending its range of objects, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
varying the angles of inclination, and for projecting
the figures on a screen. In the instrument, as ordinarily
made, the objects to be seen properly must be
placed close to the end of the reflectors; but by the
addition to the instrument of a tube containing a lens,
the rays from distant objects are brought to a focus
near the mirrors, and the image formed there is repeated
by the reflectors in the same manner as a solid
object.</p>

<p>The projection of the figures on a screen, by an
apparatus similar to a magic lantern, gives great additional
pleasure to the effects of the Kaleidoscope, as
the figures are not only seen by several persons at the
same time, but they are presented in a magnified
form. The projection of the figures also increases the
use of the instrument in designing patterns, for which
purpose it has been employed with great advantage.</p>

<p>A patent for the Kaleidoscope was taken out in
1817, but the high prices charged by the opticians
who were authorized by the inventor to sell the instrument,
and the facility with which it could be
made, occasioned a general violation of the patent
right, and it was not long before the claim of Sir
David Brewster, as the original inventor, was disputed.
In the indignant vindication of his claim, he
observes:&mdash;"There never was a popular invention
which the labours of envious individuals did not attempt
to trace to some remote period;" and the
Kaleidoscope was not an exception. It was found
that Kircher had described the effects of repeated
reflections as far back as 1630; and that Mr. Bradley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
had, in 1717, made a philosophical toy, consisting of
two small mirrors, that opened like a book, which,
when partially opened, repeated the reflections of
objects placed near it in the same manner as the
Kaleidoscope. But this instrument was so different
in its construction, and in the effects it produced,
from the Kaleidoscope, that Sir David Brewster's
claim to be the inventor may be freely admitted.
The fact that it took the world by surprise, and created
a sensation greater than any other invention had
done before, is sufficient to establish its title as an
original invention.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_MAGIC_DISC" id="THE_MAGIC_DISC">THE MAGIC DISC.</a></h2>

<p>There are several ways of illustrating the retention
by the retina of the eye of the images of objects
after they have been withdrawn from sight, but none
is so curious as the philosophical toy called the Magic
Disc, which, from the optical principles involved in
its extraordinary effects, deserves to be noticed as one
of the remarkable inventions of the present century.</p>

<p>One of the most striking methods of exhibiting the
retentive property of the retina, before the invention
of the Magic Disc, was to paint different objects at the
back and on the front of a card, and by then giving
rapid rotation to the card, both objects were seen
together. Thus, when the figure of a bird is painted
on one side, and an empty cage on the other, by rapidly
turning the card, the bird appears to be in the
cage. In the Magic Disc the objects are painted on
the same side of a circular piece of card-board, and
both are exposed to view during their rapid rotation.</p>

<p>The disc is divided into eight or ten compartments,
in each one of which the same figures are repeated,
though the positions of one or more of them are
changed. A favourite subject represented is a clown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
leaping over the back of a pantaloon, which affords
a simple illustration of the apparent relative movements
of two bodies, and will serve to explain how
the effect is produced.</p>

<div id="ip_99" class="figcenter" style="width: 354px;"><img src="images/i_b_099.jpg" width="354" height="350" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>The instrument consists of a disc of stiff card-board,
about nine inches diameter, mounted on a horizontal
pivot in the centre, on which it may be freely turned.
Between each of the compartments of the disc there
is an elongated aperture, about one inch long and a
quarter of an inch wide, for the eye to look through.
Suppose the disc to be divided into eight compartments,
by radial lines. In the compartment No. 1,
the pantaloon is represented in a stooping posture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
and the clown is on the ground ready to make a spring.
In No. 2 the pantaloon is in the same attitude, but
the clown has commenced his leap, and is raised a
little way from the ground. In the third division he
is shown still higher in the air; and in the fourth he
is mounted above the shoulders of pantaloon, who retains
the same posture as at first. The fifth compartment
represents the clown as having jumped over
pantaloon's head, and coming down to the ground;
and in each succeeding division his farther descent is
shown, till, in No. 8, he has reached the ground again,
and is ready to recommence the leap.</p>

<p>When the disc is turned rapidly round on its
pivot, the figures painted upon it are mingled together,
and present a confused medley of lines and colours,
in which no object can be distinctly defined. This
mingling of the objects is caused by the retention of
the images by the retina, so that if the eye be directed
to any point, the impression of the lines and colours
that pass rapidly before it is not effaced before another
and another appear to produce fresh impressions, and
they mingle together in confusion. If, for instance,
there were a circle formed of dots marked on the disc,
the impression of each dot on the retina would be
prolonged; and as, by the rotation, other dots would
come into the field of view before the impression of
the first was removed, it would form an unbroken
ring. But if the disc were screened from sight, at intervals
of nearly equal duration to that of the continuous
impression, so as to efface the image of one
dot before the rays of another were admitted to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
eye, then the ring would be seen to be composed of
dots, as distinctly as when the disc was stationary.</p>

<p>The effect of screening the objects from the eye at
short intervals is produced by looking with one eye
through the openings at the image of the disc, reflected
from a mirror. The figures are then seen only when
the apertures come opposite the eye; but as the impression
of one view remains till it is renewed by the
light admitted through the next aperture, there is continuous
vision of the objects painted on the disc.</p>

<p>It is thus that the figures of pantaloon and clown
become visible, and their apparent relative movements
are occasioned. For instance; each time that the impression
of the figure of the pantaloon is renewed, he
is seen in the same place and in the same attitude;
therefore he appears to be stationary, though the
successive pictures that compose his figure to the eye
are in rapid rotary motion. The figure of the clown,
however, is seen in a different position each time
that he comes into view, therefore he appears to be in
motion relatively to pantaloon, though stationary as
regards his absolute position on the disc.</p>

<p>The same effect would be produced if the disc,
during its rotation, were seen by successive electric
sparks. The electric spark is so momentary in its
duration, that the most rapidly moving objects appear
stationary; therefore each spark would show a seemingly
stationary disc, on which the figure of the clown
would appear in different relative positions; and the
illusion would be as perfect as when the rays of light
are interrupted at intervals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
The electric spark is so instantaneous that a cannon
ball might be seen in its rapid flight, if illuminated by
a flash of lightning, and would seem to be stationary.
Professor Faraday mentioned, in one of his lectures,
the extraordinary appearance which a man, who was
jumping over a stile, presented when seen by lightning
on a dark night. The man seemed to be resting
horizontally in the air, with one hand touching the
stile.</p>

<p>The duration of the impression of an object on the
retina is capable of illustration by means of the Magic
Disc in a great variety of designs, each one of which
may represent many movements. The turning of the
wheels of machinery, the tossing of balls, the dancing
figures of men and women may thus be shown, the
designs for which afford ample scope for exercising
the pencil of an ingenious artist.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_DIORAMA" id="THE_DIORAMA">THE DIORAMA.</a></h2>

<p>Those who are old enough to remember the
Regent's Park before there were any houses northward
of the New Road, may recollect that among the
first buildings erected, on what is now called Park
Square, was a strange-looking, partly semi-circular
erection, provided with ample lighting space, which
attracted great attention during its progress, and was
the cause of much speculation as to its probable purpose.
That building was intended for the exhibition
of the Diorama.</p>

<p>M. Daguerre, the inventor of the Daguerreotype,
had, in conjunction with M. Bouton, a short time previously
opened a similar exhibition in Paris, where
the beauty of the paintings, aided by the extraordinary
effects of newly contrived dispositions of the light, had
excited a great sensation. The Diorama was opened
in London on the 6th of October, 1823, and for a long
time it was equally popular in this metropolis.</p>

<p>The visitors, after passing through a gloomy anteroom,
were ushered into a circular chamber, apparently
quite dark. One or two small shrouded lamps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
placed on the floor served dimly to light the way to a
few descending steps, and the voice of an invisible
guide gave directions to walk forward. The eye soon
became sufficiently accustomed to the darkness to
distinguish the objects around, and to perceive that
there were several persons seated on benches opposite
an open space, resembling a large window. Through
the window was seen the interior of a cathedral,
undergoing partial repair, with the figures of two or
three workmen resting from their labour. The pillars,
the arches, the stone floor and steps, stained with
damp, and the planks of wood strewn on the ground,
all seemed to stand out in bold relief, so solidly as not
to admit a doubt of their substantiality, whilst the floor
extended to the distant pillars, temptingly inviting
the tread of exploring footsteps. Few could be persuaded
that what they saw was a mere painting on
a flat surface. This impression was strengthened
by perceiving the light and shadows change, as if
clouds were passing over the sun, the rays of which
occasionally shone through the painted windows,
casting coloured shadows on the floor. Then shortly
the brightness would disappear, and the former gloom
again obscure the objects that had been momentarily
illuminated. The illusion was rendered more perfect
by the excellence of the painting, and by the sensitive
condition of the eye in the darkness of the surrounding
chamber. Whilst gazing in wrapt admiration at the
architectural beauties of the cathedral, the spectator's
attention was disturbed by sounds underground. He
became conscious that the scene before him was slowly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
moving away, and he obtained a glimpse of another
and very different prospect, which gradually advanced
until it was completely developed, and the cathedral
had disappeared. What he now saw was a valley,
surrounded by high mountains capped with snow.
This mountain valley seemed scarcely less real than
the arched roof and columns of the cathedral, whilst
a foaming cascade, dashing down the rocks, and the
sound of rushing waters, added to the illusion. After
looking for some time at this beautiful valley, the
clouds were seen to gather on the mountain tops, and
a storm impended. A gleam of sun-light, still resting
on the edge of the clouds, exhibited a strange contrast
between the silvery brightness and the dense black
vapour that shrouded the hills, and could almost be
felt. It was but a passing thunderstorm. Presently
the dark clouds rose from the valley, and dispersed;
the sun again shone on cottage, vineyard, and mountain,
charming the spectator as much by the beauty
of the scene as he was astonished by the wonderful
change.</p>

<p>Such was the Diorama as it was first exhibited in
London to admiring crowds. In subsequent years
greater changes were made in the variations of light
and shade; and by the introduction of mechanical
contrivances, with more or less success, the magical
effects were increased, without, however, adding to
the apparent reality of the objects. A church or
cathedral was always the subject of one view, and
sometimes of both. The interior of an empty church
would be shown by evening twilight. The shades of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
evening gradually darkened into the obscurity of
night, and then the glimmer of candles would be seen
spreading more and more widely, until the church
was lighted up, and it was occupied by a crowded
congregation at midnight mass. Some views represented
the exterior of a ruin or of a cathedral after
sunset, and as night advanced, the stars twinkled in
the blue sky, and the moon rose and threw its silvery
light on water, buildings, and clouds, contrasting in
some cases with the red glare of lamps from the windows
of houses and shops. The disc of the moon
exactly resembled that of the real luminary, and all
around being so dark, the rays from its surface cast
shadows of intervening objects. In one picture a
still more astonishing appearance was produced, by
the change of the interior of a beautifully painted
and decorated church into a mass of charred ruins.</p>

<p>The means principally adopted for the production
of these magical changes in a painting on a flat surface,
and for giving such seeming reality to the objects
represented, were for some time kept secret;
nor do we think they are even yet much known. As
in many other clever inventions, the effects are produced
in a very simple manner. The picture is
painted on both sides of a transparent screen, and the
change of scene is occasioned almost entirely by
exhibiting the picture at one time by reflected light,
from the surface nearest the spectator, and afterwards
by transmitted light, after excluding the light from
the front.</p>

<p>Let us take for illustration the interior of a church,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
at first seen empty, and afterwards filled with people,
and illuminated by candles. The empty church is
painted on the front on fine canvas or silk, in transparent
colours, and at the back are the figures and
candles, and other objects intended to appear with
them. The arrangements for illuminating the picture
are so contrived, that the light may be thrown entirely
on the front or on the back, or partly on both.
When the light is on the front, the empty church
only is visible. It is then gradually darkened, and
the back of the picture is illuminated, by which means
the figures and candles are seen; and the form of the
building being preserved, the same church, which
was before empty, becomes occupied by a crowded
congregation.</p>

<p>It may be mentioned, as an illustration of the perfect
illusion of the Diorama, that a lady who on one
occasion accompanied the author to the exhibition,
was so fully convinced that the church represented
was real, that she asked to be conducted down the
steps to walk in the building.</p>

<div id="ip_107" class="figcenter" style="width: 420px;"><img src="images/i_b_108.jpg" width="420" height="600" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>The effect of changing the direction of the light
may be readily perceived by making a drawing on
both sides of a sheet of paper, as shown in the annexed
engraving. The side backing this page represents
the interior of St. Paul's Cathedral when empty,
and on the back several figures are drawn. Those
figures are invisible until the leaf is held up against
the light, and when the drawing is seen as a transparency,
the objects on the back, as well as those in
front, come into view, and the building appears to be
occupied.</p>

<div id="ip_107b" class="figcenter" style="width: 416px;"><img src="images/i_b_109.jpg" width="416" height="600" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
Any one who has a taste for drawing, and a little
ingenuity, may thus produce many pleasing and astonishing
effects. It will be desirable to procure, in
the first instance, a box, so contrived that it will hold
the painting, and afford the means of throwing the
light on the front or on the back at pleasure. The
diagram shows the form of such a box. The letters
<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i> mark the outside; the aperture, at <i>c d</i>, being
enlarged to permit several persons to look into it at
the same time. The box may be of any required
dimensions, to suit the size of the drawing, which is
to be fitted into a groove at <i>a b</i>, and the interior must
be blackened. The lid, <i>e</i>, when open, as in the diagram,
admits the light to the front of the picture, the
back being covered with an opaque screen. As the
lid is closed, the picture becomes darkened, and by
the gradual removal of the screen at the same time,
it is changed into a transparency. This portable
Diorama can be most conveniently shown by lamplight,
the flame of an argand lamp, the wick of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
can be heightened and lowered, being best adapted
for the purpose. The effect by daylight is, however,
superior, but the room must then be darkened, and
the admission of light confined to the picture.</p>

<div id="ip_111" class="figcenter" style="width: 275px;"><img src="images/i_b_110.jpg" width="275" height="193" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>The moving water, and the motion of smoke and
clouds, which were frequently introduced in the Diorama,
were mechanical additions, the effects being
produced by giving motion to bodies behind, the
forms of which were seen by transmitted light. The
introduction of such mechanical aids, however, detract
from the artistic character of the Diorama, the
principal merit of which consists in exhibiting the
changes occasioned by variations in the mode of throwing
the light on the two-faced picture.</p>

<p>It is to be regretted that exhibitions of a larger
and more showy kind should have superseded the
Diorama in public estimation; and that, from the
want of support, their charming and marvellous pictorial
representations, which formed, in days gone by,
one of the principal "sights" of London, should be
now closed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="THE_STEREOSCOPE" id="THE_STEREOSCOPE">THE STEREOSCOPE.</a></h2>

<p>One of the most beautiful as well as the most
remarkable pictorial illusions is produced by the combination
of two views into one by the recently invented
instrument called the Stereoscope. In the Diorama,
in the Magic Disc, and in the Dissolving Views, separate
paintings combine to produce different effects;
but in the Stereoscope the two pictures unite into one
to give additional effect to the same view, and to make
that which is a flat surface, when seen singly, appear
to project like a solid body.</p>

<p>The principle of the Stereoscope depends on the
different appearance which near objects present when
seen by the right or by the left eye. For instance,
on looking at a book placed edgewise, with the right
eye, the back and one side of the book will be perceived;
and on closing the right eye and opening the
left, the back and the other side of the book will be
seen, and the right-hand side will be invisible. It is
the combination of both these views by vision with
two eyes that produces the impression of solidity of
objects on the mind; and if the different appearances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
which the book presents to each eye be copied in
separate drawings, and they can afterwards be placed
in such a position as to form a united image on the
retinæ of the eyes, the same effect is produced as if
the book itself were looked upon.</p>

<div id="ip_113" class="figcenter" style="width: 311px;"><img src="images/i_b_113.jpg" width="311" height="119" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>This diagram represents the outlines of a near object,
as seen by each eye separately. The one on the
right hand shows it as seen with the right eye, and
the other as it looks with the left eye; and if both
drawings be combined into one image, it stands out in
bold relief. This may be done without any instrument,
by squinting at them; but the effect is more readily
and far more agreeably produced by the Stereoscope,
so named from the Greek words στερος {steros}, solid, and
σκοπεω {skopeô}, to see.</p>

<p>Professor Wheatstone claims to be the first who
contrived an instrument to illustrate this effect of
binocular vision, and he also claims to be the first
who brought to notice the different appearances of
objects seen with each eye separately. Sir David
Brewster, however, disputes, on behalf of Mr. Elliot,
of Edinburgh, Professor Wheatstone's claim to the invention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
of the first stereoscopic instrument; and he
has shown that the difference of vision with each eye
was remarked by Galen, 1,700 years ago; that it was
noticed by Leonardo da Vinci in 1500, and formed
the subject of a treatise by a Jesuit, named Francis
Aquilonius, in 1613; and that it was a well-known phenomenon
of vision long before it was mentioned by
Professor <span class="locked">Wheatstone.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></span> Mr. Elliot, though he conceived
the idea, in 1834, of constructing an instrument
for uniting two dissimilar pictures, did not carry it
into effect until 1839, the year after Mr. Wheatstone
had exhibited his reflecting Stereoscope to the
Royal Society, and at the meeting of the British Association.</p>

<p>Mr. Elliot's contrivance, to which Sir David Brewster
is inclined to give precedence in point of date,
was very inferior in its effects to the reflecting Stereoscope.
It was without lenses or mirrors, and consisted
of a wooden box 18 inches long, 7 inches broad, and
4½ deep, and at the end of it was placed the dissimilar
pictures, as seen by each eye, that were to be united
into one. The view he drew for the purpose comprised
the moon, a cross, and the stump of a tree, at
different distances; and when looked at in the box,
the cross and the stump of the tree appeared to stand
out in relief.</p>

<p>The accompanying woodcut represents the original
stereoscopic pictures, copied from Sir David Brewster's
book; and by looking towards the picture on the left
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>with the right eye, and on the right-hand picture with
the left eye, the two will be seen united, and the
cross and the stump of the tree will appear to stand
out solidly.</p>

<div id="ip_115" class="figcenter" style="width: 383px;"><img src="images/i_b_115.jpg" width="383" height="192" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>The arrangement of the apparatus, as described
by Professor Wheatstone, in his paper read before the
Royal Society, consists of two plane mirrors, about
4 inches square, placed at right angles; and the drawings,
made on separate pieces of paper, were reflected
to the eyes looking into the mirrors at their junction.
The diagram is a sketch of this arrangement. In the
middle of a narrow slip of wood, <i>d e</i>, about 12 inches
long, the two mirrors, <i>a b</i>, are fixed, inclined at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
required angle from their line of junction at <i>c</i>. Upright
pieces of wood, <i>d h</i>, <i>e f</i>, at each end, are furnished
with slides or clips to hold the drawings, which
are reflected from the inclined mirrors, and seen in
them by each eye separately. Thus, the left eye sees
only the picture fixed on <i>d h</i>, and the right eye sees
the one placed at <i>e f</i>; and the two images, being combined
at the seat of vision, produce the same impression
as a solid body.</p>

<div id="ip_116" class="figcenter" style="width: 398px;"><img src="images/i_b_115b.jpg" width="398" height="131" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>It is almost unnecessary to describe the external
appearance of the lenticular instrument invented by
Sir David Brewster, and explained by him at the
meeting of the British Association in 1849. In the
best kind of instruments the glasses, through which
the pictures are seen, are composed of a single large
double-convex lens, divided in the middle, the thin
edges being set towards each other, about 2½ inches
apart. The more improved instruments, indeed, are
made from lenses upwards of 3 inches in diameter,
which, being cut into two, and the thin parts being
ground flat, are set edge to edge, and from an aperture
sufficiently large for both eyes to look through.
By this means the instrument suits all eyes, without
requiring adjustment, and the field of view is increased.
A diaphragm, or partition, placed at the
junction of the two lenses, confines the vision of each
eye to its appropriated picture, and thus tends to
prevent the confusion of images that might otherwise
arise.</p>

<p>The object of using semi-lenses is to facilitate the
union of the two pictures into one, by looking through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
the lens towards its edge, instead of through the
centre, the image being thus refracted to a different
position. This may be easily exemplified by looking
at an object steadily through different parts of the
same lens. After looking at it with the right eye
through the centre, and whilst keeping the axis of the
eye in the same direction, move the lens slowly towards
the right, so as to bring the edge of the lens
opposite the pupil. This movement of the lens towards
the right hand will be accompanied by an apparent
movement of the image towards the left, so as
to bring it to a point between the two eyes. If the
experiment be repeated with the left eye, the image
will be removed towards the right hand; and thus,
by looking at the two stereoscopic pictures through
the thin parts of two lenses, the images are superposed
and form a single one.</p>

<p>Sir David Brewster attached much importance to
the semi-lenses, which have the effect of prisms in
refracting the rays of light; but that form of lens is
not essential to give apparent solidity to the images;
and many of the commoner kind of instruments are
now made with ordinary double-convex lenses, and
without any partition. With the semi-lens, however,
there is less difficulty in uniting the two pictures into
one than when an ordinary lens is employed.</p>

<p>In taking photographic pictures for the Stereoscope
with a single camera, it is necessary to alter the angle
of the instrument after having taken one picture, to
direct it to the same object in the angle of vision as
seen by the other eye. This method of producing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
stereoscopic pictures with the same camera is very
objectionable when any moving objects are in the
field; for they will be in a different position in each,
and sometimes disappear altogether from the second
picture. The plan adopted by the best photographers
is to have two cameras set at the requisite angle to
each other, so that both pictures or portraits may be
taken at the same time.</p>

<p>At the meeting of the British Association in 1853,
M. Claudet endeavoured to establish some rules for the
angle at which photographic pictures must be taken,
in order to produce the best effect of relief and distance
without exaggeration. He observed, that in
looking at a single picture with two eyes, there is
less relief and less distance than when looking at it
with one eye, because in the latter case we have the
same effect we are accustomed to feel when we look
at the natural objects with one eye; while, if we look
at the single picture with two eyes, we have on the
two retinæ the same image with the same perspective,
which is not natural, and the eyes have not to make
the usual effort for altering their convergence according
to the plane on which the object observed is
situated. This inaction of the convergence of the eyes
diminishes the illusion of the picture, because the
same convergence for all the objects represented gives
an idea that they are all placed on the same plane.
The photographic image being the representation of
two different perspectives, we must, when we look at
them in the Stereoscope, as when looking at the natural
objects themselves, converge, more or less, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
axes of the eyes. Therefore we make the same effort,
and have the same sensation in regarding the combined
photographic pictures, as when we look at the
objects represented.</p>

<p>Sir David Brewster has suggested various applications
of the Stereoscope; viz., to painting, to sculpture
and engineering, to natural history, to education,
and to purposes of amusement. The latter is the principal
purpose to which the instrument is at present
applied; and some of the many ways in which it may
contribute to delight the spectator are pointed out in
Sir David Brewster's book.</p>

<p>"For the purpose of amusement," he observes,
"the photographer might carry us even into the regions
of the supernatural. His art enables him to
give a spiritual appearance to one or more of his
figures, and to exhibit them as 'thin air,' amid the
solid realities of the stereoscopic picture. While a
party are engaged with their whist or their gossip, a
female figure appears in the midst of them with all
the attributes of the supernatural. Her form is
transparent; every object or person beyond her being
seen in shadowy but distinct outline. She may
occupy more than one place in the scene, and different
portions of the group might be made to gaze upon
one or other of the visions before them. In order to
produce such a scene, the parties which are to compose
the group must have their portraits nearly finished
in the binocular camera, in the attitude which
they may be supposed to assume if the vision were
real. When the party have nearly sat the proper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
length of time, the female figure, suitably attired,
walks quickly to the place assigned to her, and after
standing a few seconds in the proper attitude, retires
quickly, or takes as quickly a second, or even a third,
place in the picture, if it is required, in each of which
she remains a few seconds, so that her picture in these
different positions may be taken with sufficient distinctness
in the negative photograph. If these operations
have been well performed, all the objects immediately
behind the female figure, having been
previous to her introduction impressed upon the negative
surface, will be seen through her, and she will
have the appearance of an aërial personage, unlike the
other figures in the picture."</p>

<p>It is in the foregoing manner that the remarkable
stereoscopic effect of "Sir David Brewster's ghost"
is produced, a representation of which is given in the
next page.</p>

<p>Sir David Brewster mentions many other curious
applications of the Stereoscope, among which are the
dioramic effects of pictures seen alternately by reflected
and by transmitted light; a daylight view
being apparently lighted up artificially in the night,
by seeing it at one time with the light reflected from
the surface, and then excluding the light from the
front, and viewing it as a transparency.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting effects of the Stereoscope
has been recently produced by Mr. De la Rue,
who has contrived the means of giving apparent
rotundity to the surface of the moon, as viewed
through a powerful telescope. The disc of the full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
moon, however highly magnified, presents, as is well-known,
the appearance of a flat surface, with the
lights and shadows marked seemingly on a plane.
Owing to the great distance of that luminary, there
is no variation in its appearance, whether it be looked
at with one eye or with the other, therefore it seems
removed beyond the operation of the ordinary cause
of stereoscopic effects. Nevertheless, Mr. De la Rue
has taken photographs of the moon which, when
placed in the Stereoscope, combine to form a solid-looking
globe, on which all the lights and shadows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
are distinctly and beautifully delineated. He has
produced this effect by taking his photographs at
different periods of the year, when there is a slight
variation in the direction of the moon's face to the
earth; and by combining these separate photographs
into one image in the Stereoscope, the form of the
moon appears as convex as the surface of an artificial
globe.</p>

<div id="ip_122" class="figcenter" style="width: 341px;"><img src="images/i_b_121.jpg" width="341" height="373" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>M. Claudet, who is one of the most successful
photographers in the metropolis, has contrived an arrangement
which he calls a "Stereomonoscope," by
which the appearance of solidity is communicated to
a single image formed on a screen of ground glass.
The screen of ground glass has a black back, and is
placed in the focus of a lens in an ordinary camera
obscura, wherein the image may be seen by looking
down upon it. The particles of the roughened glass
reflect to each eye different parts of the image focused
on the screen, and by this means a similar effect is
produced as when two dissimilar pictures are looked
at through a stereoscope instrument. One great advantage
of this arrangement is that several persons
may look at the image at the same time.</p>

<p>Mr. John Sang, of Kirkaldy, has very recently
imparted stereoscopic effect to copies of paintings and
engravings, the flat surfaces of which were previously
thought to defy any such application of the Stereoscope.
The means he employs of doing so are at
present kept secret, but he has shown its practicability
by copying, on wood engravings, Mr. George Cruikshank's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
series of "The Bottle." In some respects this
process seems almost more wonderful than the original
Stereoscope, for it gives solid form and apparent
substantiality to the mere creations of the artist's
pencil.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_ELECTRIC_TELEGRAPH" id="THE_ELECTRIC_TELEGRAPH">THE ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH.</a></h2>

<p>No application of science has so completely realized
the visions of fancy as the Electric Telegraph.
So closely, indeed, does the real of the present day
approach to the ideal of ages past, that it might be
supposed the narratives in the tales of faëry land
were true records of the inventions of former times,
and that the combined efforts of inventive genius
during the last half century were but imitations and
reproductions of what had been successfully accomplished
"once upon a time." There is also an intermediate
period&mdash;between the indefinite of faëry tales
and the positive of scientific history&mdash;in which sympathetic
tablets and magical loadstones, scarcely less
mythical, are stated to have been invented; and the
individuals are named who thus paved the way for
instantaneous communication between all parts of the
world.</p>

<p>The Jesuits of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
took the place of the magicians of the Middle
Ages. In the seclusion of their monasteries, they
speculated on the mysterious powers of Nature, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
partially revealed to them, and shadowed forth
images of their possible applications. It is to a
vague speculation of this kind that we may attribute
the notice given by Strada, in his "Prolusiones Academicæ,"
of the sympathetic magnetic needles, by
which two friends at a distance were able to communicate;
though the then fanciful idea has been
literally realized. A still more extraordinary foreshadowing
of one of the most recent improvements
of the Electric Telegraph was the transference of written
letters from one place to another by electric
agency. This is said to have been accomplished by
Kircher, who, in his "Prolusiones Magneticæ," describes,
though very vaguely, the mode of operation.
But even admitting that there were substantial foundations
for these imaginary phantasms, that would not
in the least detract from the merit of those who, following
closely the footsteps of scientific discovery,
have successfully applied the principles unfolded
by the investigations of others, and by their own assiduous
researches. Thus, whilst steam navigation
was facilitating the means of intercourse over rivers
and seas, and whilst railways and locomotive engines
served to bring distant cities within a few hours'
journey of each other, another source of power, infinitely
more rapid in its action than steam, has been
made to transmit intelligence from place to place, and
from one country to another, with the speed of
lightning.</p>

<p>The plan of making communications by signals
has been in operation from time immemorial; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
beacon lights on hills having served in ancient as
well as in modern times to give warning of danger, or
to announce tidings of joy. Such simple signals were
not capable of much variety of expression; but even
beacon lights might be made to indicate different
kinds of intelligence, by multiplying the number of
the fires, and by altering their relative positions. It
was not, however, till the invention of telegraphs that
anything approaching to the means of holding regular
communication by signals was attained. The semaphore
of the brothers Chappe, of France, invented by
them in 1794, was the most perfect instrument of the
kind, and was generally employed for telegraphic
purposes, until it was supplanted by the Electric
Telegraph.</p>

<p>The semaphore consisted of an upright post, having
arms on each side, that could be readily extended,
at any given angle. The extension of these arms on
one side or the other, either separately or together,
and at different angles, constituted a variety of signals
sufficient for the purposes of communication. The
semaphores, erected on elevated points, so as to be
visible through telescopes, signalled intelligence
slowly from one station to another, till it reached its
ultimate destination; and thus&mdash;daylight and clear
weather permitting&mdash;brief orders could be sent from
the Admiralty to Portsmouth in the course of a few
minutes. But the communication was liable to be
interrupted by fogs, as well as by nightfall.</p>

<p>A remarkable instance of the imperfection of sight
telegraphs occurred during the Peninsular War. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
telegraphic despatch, received at the Admiralty from
Portsmouth, announced&mdash;"Lord Wellington defeated;"&mdash;and
then the communication was interrupted
by a fog. This telegraphic message caused great consternation,
and the utmost anxiety was experienced to
learn the extent of the supposed disaster. When,
however, the fog dispersed, the remainder of the message
gave a completely opposite character to the
news, which in its completed form ran thus: "Lord
Wellington defeated the French," &amp;c.</p>

<p>Some better means of transmitting important intelligence
was evidently wanted; for not only was
the semaphore liable to frequent interruptions by the
weather, but its action was very slow, and the frequent
repetitions from station to station increased the
risk of blunders.</p>

<p>The instantaneous transmission of an electric shock
suggested the means of communicating with greatly
increased rapidity; and when it was ascertained, by
experiments made by Dr. Watson at Shooter's Hill, in
1747, that the charge of a Leyden jar could be sent
through a circuit of four miles, with velocity too
great to be appreciable, the practicability of applying
electricity for conveying intelligence became at once
apparent.</p>

<p>Of the many means by which this object was
attempted to be accomplished, it will be only possible,
in this general survey, to notice those that mark
the first steps of the invention, and the most important
of those that have accompanied its progress to the
present time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
The first method that suggested itself was to transmit
signals by means of pith-ball electrometers.
When, for instance, two pith-balls are suspended from
a wire that is made to form part of an electric circuit,
the electricity communicated to the balls causes them
to diverge, and when the electricity in the wire is
discharged, they immediately collapse. This action
of pith-balls, when electrified, was the simplest mode
known of making telegraphic signals, and it was accordingly
adopted by several of the early inventors of
Electric Telegraphs. The first person who proposed
to apply it for that purpose was M. Lesage, of Geneva,
in 1774. His plan was to form 24 electric circuits
by as many separate wires, insulated from each
other in glass tubes; and to place in the circuit, at
each communicating station, an equal number of pith-ball
electrometers. Each electrometer was to represent
a letter of the alphabet, and they were to be
brought into action by an excited glass rod. When a
communication was to be made, the wires connected
with the separate galvanometers were to be charged
alternately with electricity by the excited rod of
glass; and the person at the receiving station, by
noticing which of the electrometers were successively
put into action, could spell the words intended to be
communicated.</p>

<p>By the means thus proposed, correspondence could
have taken place at only short distances, for the
charge of an excited glass rod would have been too
feeble to produce any sensible effect on the electrometers
had the length of the circuit been considerable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
This difficulty might have been overcome by
substituting the charge of a Leyden jar for the excited
glass; but the more serious obstacle to the use of
such a telegraph would have been the cost, and the
difficulty of insulating the 24 wires required to work
it.</p>

<p>Most of the early telegraphic inventors encumbered
their inventions with the same obstacle, as they
seemed to consider it necessary to have a separate
circuit for each letter of the alphabet. It was not so
however, with all; for M. Lomond, a Frenchman, who
ranks second in the list of telegraphic inventors,
modified the principle of M. Lesage, so as to enable
him to work with only two wires and one electrometer
at each station. With the experience since gained in
the application of the needle telegraph, such an
arrangement seems very simple, and we are inclined
to wonder that it was not generally adopted, especially
after M. Lomond had shown the way.</p>

<p>To produce all the requisite signals with a single
pith-ball electrometer, it was necessary to vary the
durations of each divergence, and to combine several
to form a single symbol. Thus, suppose that a single
divergence of the pith-balls for a second was understood
to signify the letter <i>A</i>; one divergence, followed
by an immediate collapse, by discharging the electricity,
might signify <i>B</i>; two prolonged divergences
might signify <i>C</i>, and two short ones <i>D</i>; and by thus
increasing the number and varying the divergences
of the two pith-balls, all the letters of the alphabet
might be indicated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
A still more direct method of representing the
letters of the alphabet was proposed by M. Reizen in
1794, by the application of the means frequently
adopted for exhibiting the light of the electric spark.
The charge of a Leyden jar was sent through strips of
tin foil, pasted on to a flat piece of glass, so as to form
several lines, joined at the ends alternately into a continuous
circuit. Interruptions were made in the foil
by cutting small portions away, at which points
brilliant sparks appeared when the jar was discharged.
As the interruptions were so contrived as to form
letters, and the strips of tin foil were all arranged
separately on a long pane of glass, any letter required
could be distinctly made visible by discharging the
jar through that particular circuit. To produce all
the letters of the alphabet in this manner, a separate
circuit was required for each.</p>

<p>Another plan, far less feasible, and scarcely deserving
of notice, excepting for its peculiarity, was
proposed in the following year by M. Cavallo, who
suggested the setting fire to combustibles, or the explosion
of detonating substances, as the means of
signalling intelligence. About the same time several
attempts were made by electricians in Spain to transmit
signals by electricity, but their plans were not
more practicable than those already mentioned, and
depended for their effects on the discharge of Leyden
jars.</p>

<p>The discovery of voltaic electricity at the beginning
of the present century was an important step in the
progress of the Electric Telegraph, though several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
years elapsed before the applicability of the discovery
for that purpose became known; and it was not fully
appreciated till within the last twenty years.</p>

<p>The electricity generated by the voltaic battery is
far greater in quantity than the most powerful electrical
machine can excite, whilst its intensity is so feeble
that it cannot pass in a spark through the smallest
interval of air. It presents, therefore, much less
difficulty in the insulation of the wires than frictional
electricity, whilst the rapidity of its transmission is for
practical purposes equally efficient. The electricity
generated by the voltaic battery being great in quantity
and feeble in intensity, it is capable also of
effecting chemical decomposition and of imparting
magnetism, both of which properties have proved
eminently useful in perfecting the Electric Telegraph.</p>

<p>The first application of voltaic electricity to telegraphic
purposes was made by Mr. Soemmering in
1809. The signals of his telegraph consisted of the
bubbles of gas arising from the decomposition of water,
during the action of the electric current. His apparatus
consisted of a small glass trough, filled with
acidulated water, through the bottom part of which
were introduced several gold wires corresponding to
the letters of the alphabet. The instant that an electric
current was sent through any two of the wires, by
making connection with a voltaic battery at the transmitting
instrument, bubbles of hydrogen gas rose
from one of the gold wires, and bubbles of oxygen gas
from another; and as the volume of hydrogen gas,
liberated during the decomposition of water, exceeds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
by sixteen times that of the oxygen, it was easy to
distinguish them. In this manner all the letters of the
alphabet could be indicated by using 24 wires. The
object of having gold wires in the decomposing trough
was to prevent the oxidation of the metal; for had
copper, or any other metal that combines with oxygen,
been employed, the points of the wires would soon
have become corroded.</p>

<p>This telegraph of Soemmering's, though not adapted
for practical application in the form he presented
it, on account of the number of wires required for the
purpose, was nevertheless superior to any that had
previously been invented; and by a little modification
it might have been made a perfect instrument, capable
of transmitting messages by means of only two
wires. Such a modification of the instrument was
proposed by M. Schweigger, twenty years afterwards;
the only thing required being the adoption of a code
of symbols, by means of which all the letters might
be indicated by combinations of the four primary signals
that are obtainable by two wires, as is at present
done by the needle telegraph in common use. At
that time, however, the discovery of the magnetic
properties of the electric current, and other improvements
in the means of communicating, superseded for
some years the use of signals made by electro-chemical
decomposition.</p>

<p>The next important step in the progress of telegraphic
invention, after that of Mr. Soemmering, was
made by Mr. Ronalds, who in 1816 succeeded in
making a perfect apparatus, that transmitted every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
requisite signal with the use of only a single circuit.
In the agent employed, however, there was a retrogression
to frictional electricity and the pith-ball
electrometer, for at that time the property which a
voltaic current possesses of deflecting a magnetic
needle had not been discovered.</p>

<p>Mr. Ronalds's plan was to have, at each communicating
station, a good clock with a light paper disc
fixed on to the seconds wheel, on which were marked
all the letters of the alphabet, and the ten numerals.
Only so much of this disc was exposed to view as to
show a single letter at a time, through a small aperture,
as the seconds wheel revolved. The clocks at
the corresponding stations were set exactly together,
so that the same letter was exposed to view at each
instrument at the same instant. A pith-ball electrometer,
connected in a single circuit with the transmitting
station, was kept distended during the transmission
of a message by charging the wire from an electrical
machine; and when the letter required to be indicated
appeared at the aperture of both instruments,
the operator at the transmitting instrument instantly
discharged the electricity of the wire by touching it,
and thus caused the pith-balls to collapse. In this
manner the person at the receiving station, by attentively
watching the pith-balls, and noticing the letter
that appeared at the instant of collapse, could read
the messages signalled.</p>

<p>Mr. Ronalds so far perfected his invention, that it
worked accurately, though slowly, through eight miles
of wire insulated in glass tubes. Having thus succeeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
in putting into action his single wire telegraph,
Mr. Ronalds sought the patronage of Government for
its practical adoption, such a notion as that of establishing
a telegraph for commercial purposes not being
at that time entertained. For a length of time his
application received no attention, and when at length
the Lords of the Admiralty condescended to answer,
they sent Mr. Ronalds, as the reward for his ingenuity,
and as compensation for the time and money bestowed
in perfecting the invention, the expression of their
opinion&mdash;that "telegraphs are of no use in time of
peace, and that during war the semaphore answered
all required purposes"! This reply, so characteristic
of the manner in which Government <i>employés</i> generally
regard anything new to which their attention is solicited,
completely disheartened Mr. Ronalds. He
abandoned the Electric Telegraph to its fate; and
having gone abroad, he returned some years later to
find that, notwithstanding the <i>dictum</i> of the Lords of
the Admiralty, telegraphs are of great use in time of
peace as well as of war, and that the old semaphore
had been entirely superseded by the means of transmission
he had indicated twenty years before. Mr.
Ronalds has since received a small pension, not however
as a reward for his ingenious telegraph invention,
but for his services in other departments of science.</p>

<p>The discovery of the magnetic property of an
electric current by Professor Œrsted, in 1818, was
most important in the subsequent progress of telegraphic
invention, though it was not applied in a practical
manner till nearly twenty years afterwards. In 1820,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
indeed, M. Ampère submitted to the Academy of
Sciences at Paris a telegraphic instrument for the
transmission of signals by the deflection of needles,
but he adopted the impracticable plan of the earliest
inventors, of having a separate wire for each letter of
the alphabet. A much more important contribution
to telegraphic invention by M. Ampère was the discovery
of electro-magnets, which act an important
part in many recent electric telegraphs.</p>

<p>As the magnetic properties of a voltaic current
are extensively applied in electric telegraphs, it is desirable
briefly to explain the nature of the action of
voltaic batteries before proceeding farther with the
history of the invention.</p>

<p>To excite a current of voltaic electricity, it is usual
to employ a series of zinc and copper plates, arranged
alternately in separate jars; or, what is now most
common, in cells of gutta percha, separated from each
other in a gutta percha trough. The cells are nearly
filled with diluted sulphuric acid, and a wire is attached
to each end of the trough; one being connected
with the last zinc plate, and the other with the last
copper plate of the opposite ends of the trough.
When these wires are brought into contact, electricity
is instantly generated by the action of the acid on the
zinc plates. The electricity excited by the action on
the zinc in one cell is carried on to the next, and that
again excites and transfers an additional quantity to
the third cell, thus increasing in intensity to the last
pair of plates in the series. The <i>electric current</i>, as it
is called, passes along the wire, and whether the wire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
be one yard, or whether it be a hundred miles long,
the generation of electricity takes place the instant
that the circuit is completed, and ends the instant that
the circuit is broken. There is this difference, however,
in the transmission of electricity through a long
and through a short circuit, that in the former case the
increased resistance offered by the length of the wire
greatly diminishes the quantity of electricity transmitted
though it does not perceptibly retard the
velocity.</p>

<p>When a balanced magnetic needle is held above a
short thick copper wire whilst it is transmitting an
electric current, the needle is deflected from its natural
position, and inclines either to the right or to the left,
according to the direction in which the current passes.
If, for instance, the north pole of the needle be pointed
towards the copper pole of the battery, it will be deflected
towards the east, but if the direction of the
battery current be reversed, the deflection will be
towards the west. The effect instantly ceases when
the current is interrupted by breaking connection
with either pole of the battery. The copper wire,
though under ordinary circumstances incapable of
being rendered magnetic, thus becomes endowed with
strong magnetic properties when it is transmitting an
electric current, and acts on the magnetic needle in
the same manner as if there were an immense number
of small magnets placed along the wire across its
diameter.</p>

<p>The magnetic property of an electric current, first
discovered by Œrsted, was applied by M. Ampère<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
to impart magnetism to iron, by coiling a length of
copper wire round a bar of iron, taking care to cover
the wire with an insulating substance, so that when an
electric current was transmitted the electricity might
not pass through the iron. Coils of copper wire,
covered with cotton or silk, can thus impart most
powerful magnetism to a piece of soft iron; but it
loses its magnetic power the instant that the electric
current is interrupted.</p>

<p>The effect of a coil of insulated wire in increasing
the magnetic power of an electric current, was applied
by M. Schweigger in 1832 to increase the sensitiveness
of a suspended magnetic needle. By surrounding
a compass needle with several convolutions of
covered wire, it was found that the deflections of the
needle were much greater and more active; and he
thus showed the way to the construction of those delicate
galvanometers, which indicate by their deflections
the slightest disturbance of electrical equilibrium.
Schweigger may, therefore, be considered the
original inventor of the Needle Telegraph; and as he
pointed out a method of impressing symbols on paper
mechanically, by means of electro-magnets, he may
be considered also as the original inventor of Recording
Electric Telegraphs.</p>

<p>The first near approach to the needle telegraph,
now used in this country, was made by Baron de
Schilling, who, in 1832, constructed at St. Petersburg
an electric telegraph consisting of five magnetic
needles. This may be considered as the precursor of
the five-needle telegraph, first patented by Professor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
Wheatstone in 1837. By the separate deflection of
those needles to the right hand or to the left, by reversing
the connections with the poles of the batteries,
ten primary signals could be obtained; and by
bringing two into action at the same time, many
more signals might be made than were required for
indicating the letters of the alphabet, and they could
be appropriated to express several words. For the
action of this very efficient telegraph only five wires
were required, and the signals being all primary ones,
the messages might have been transmitted very
<span class="locked">quickly.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></span> In a subsequent modification of the telegraph,
he contrived to make all the signals with one
magnetic needle alone, by repeating the deflections
to the right and to the left, as done in the needle telegraph
now generally used in England.</p>

<p>Another step made by Baron de Schilling was the
invention of an alarum to call attention when a message
was about to be sent. Some contrivance of this
kind was considered essential in the early days of the
practical application of the Electric Telegraph, as no
one then contemplated that telegraphic communications
would be so frequent as to require a person to
be always near the instrument, waiting for the receipt
of messages.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span></p>
<p>Baron de Schilling's alarum was very simple.
One of the magnetic needles acted as a detent which
held a weight suspended, and when the needle was
deflected, the weight fell upon a bell. The alarums
subsequently invented were constructed on the same
principle, but instead of employing one of the magnetic
needles as a detent, an electro-magnet was used
for the purpose, and clock mechanism was introduced
to sound a bell continuously, as soon as it was set in
action by the withdrawal of the detent. At the
present time alarums are not used in the regular stations
of the electric telegraph companies; the sound
of the needles, as they strike against the ivory rests
on each side, being sufficient to call the attention of
the clerks, who are in constant attendance.</p>

<p>We have hitherto been enabled to trace, step by
step, the advances made at intervals&mdash;years asunder&mdash;in
bringing the Electric Telegraph into practical
use; but we are now approaching a time when it becomes
difficult to enumerate, and impossible to describe
within reasonable compass, the numerous inventions
that were patented and otherwise made
known for giving greater efficiency to that means of
communication.</p>

<p>In the early part of the year 1837, the electric
telegraphs of Mr. Alexander, of Edinburgh, and of
Mr. Davy, were publicly exhibited in London, and
excited much attention; though, at that time it was
not supposed that it would be possible to make use of
that means of communication for general purposes.
Mr. Alexander's telegraph was the same in principle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
as those of M. Ampère and of Baron de Schilling,
though in some respects not so efficient as either, for
its action was slow, and it required a separate wire for
each letter of the alphabet. It was considered a great
advantage of this telegraph at the time, that it exhibited
actual letters of the alphabet, instead of
symbols. This was effected by having the twenty-six
letters painted on a board, and concealed from
view by a number of small paper screens, which
were attached to magnetic needles. When any of
the needles was deflected by sending an electric
current through the surrounding coil, the screen
was withdrawn and exposed the letter behind.
Twenty-six keys, resembling those of a pianoforte,
were ranged in connection, one with each wire, and
on pressing down any one of the keys, contact was
made between the battery and the wire connected
with its associated magnetic needle; and in this
manner, messages might easily be transmitted and
read. The objections to this telegraph, in the form
in which it was exhibited, were not only the impracticability
of laying down and insulating so
many wires, but the paper screens attached to the
needles impeded their action, and rendered the
transmission a very slow process. It is questionable,
indeed, whether that telegraph could have been
worked at all through a circuit of many miles.</p>

<p>Mr. Davy's telegraph was similar to that of Mr.
Alexander's, though much more compact and better
arranged. The letters were painted on ground glass,
lighted behind, so that when the screens were withdrawn
the letters were seen in transparency.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span></p>

<div id="ip_141" class="figcenter" style="width: 261px;"><img src="images/i_b_141.jpg" width="261" height="405" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>Professor Wheatstone, who had for some previous
years been endeavouring to perfect a practical electric
telegraph, took out his first patent in 1837. It
closely resembled in general features the telegraph
of Baron de Schilling. It consisted of five magnetic
needles, ranged side by side on a horizontal line that
formed the diameter of a rhomb. The needles were
suspended perpendicularly, being kept in that position
by having the lower ends made slightly heavier
than the upper. The rhomb was divided into thirty-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>six
equal parts by ten cross lines, and the needles
were placed at the points where the lines intersected,
as shown in the diagram.</p>

<p>At each intersection, and along the boundary
lines of the rhomb, letters were marked, any one of
which might be pointed at by the combined action of
two of the needles. Thus, if the two extreme needles
were deflected inwards, one towards the left and the
other towards the right, they would point to the
letter <i>A</i> at the top of the rhomb. If the extreme
needle on the left and the fourth one were similarly
deflected, they would point to the letter <i>B</i>; and thus
all the letters marked on the intersections of the lines
could be pointed to. A telegraph that could be
worked with five circuits came within the range of
practicability, and it was put into operation on the
Great Western Railway as far as Slough, a distance
of 18 miles.</p>

<p>When the work of actually making communication
by insulated wires between places far apart
came to be done, much difficulty arose as to the best
and cheapest mode of doing it. The plan first attempted
was to surround the wires with pitch, and to
bury them in a trench in the ground. But this was
found to be attended with great inconvenience, for
the pitch cracked, and electric communication was
established between the adjacent wires. The method
of suspending the wires on posts was, we understand,
suggested by Mr. Brunel, who had seen wires so suspended
for other purposes on the Continent, and he
recommended it to Mr. Cooke for the Electric Telegraph.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
The plan was tried with success, and was
generally adopted by the Electric Telegraph Company
in extending their lines over the country. We
shall have occasion to revert to this practical part
of the subject, when describing more particularly the
means of making communication from one place to
another.</p>

<p>In continuing the history of the invention, as regards
the different modes by which communications
are transmitted along the insulated wires, the next
telegraphs that deserve notice are those of Dr. Steinheil,
which became known also in 1837. One of his
telegraphs made the signals by sounds, produced by
magnetic needles striking, when deflected, against
bells of different tones. By another telegraph of his
invention the symbols where marked upon paper by
small tubes holding ink, fixed to the needles. In this
manner the letters of the alphabet were indicated by
dots upon a strip of paper, kept slowly moving by
clock mechanism. This telegraph could be worked
by a single circuit; and it appears that Dr. Steinheil
was the first who discovered, or at least who practically
applied, the conducting power of the earth for
the return current. Each circuit, therefore, consisted
of only a single wire; the wire that had been previously
used to complete the circuit being superseded
by burying in the earth, at each terminus, a small
copper plate. Dr. Steinheil also introduced the use
of galvanized iron wire. An electric telegraph of
this construction was put into operation at Munich,
through a distance of 12 miles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span></p>

<div id="ip_144" class="figcenter" style="width: 265px;"><img src="images/i_b_144.jpg" width="265" height="183" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>In the following year Messrs. Cooke and Wheatstone
so far simplified the arrangements of their
needle telegraph as to make all the requisite signals
with two needles. With a single combined battery
and two wires six primary signals are thus obtained;
and by repeating the deflections and combining the
action of the two needles, all the letters can be readily
and quickly indicated. A single needle instrument
was invented by Messrs. Cooke and Wheatstone, but
as there are only two primary signals, one to the right
and one to the left, the deflections are necessarily repeated
more frequently, and the transmission is consequently
more slow. The accompanying diagram
represents the alphabet of the single needle instrument.
The deflections for each letter commence in the direction
of the short marks, and end with the long
ones. Thus, to indicate the letter <i>R</i>, the needle is first
deflected once to the left and then once to the right;
and the letter <i>D</i> has the deflections reversed, beginning
with one to the right and ending with one to the
left. In no instance does it require more than four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
deflections to indicate a single letter, yet the transmission
with the double needle is found so much
quicker that the single needle instrument is only
rarely used.</p>

<p>At the end of each word, it is customary for the
clerk at the receiving station to indicate, by a deflection
of the needle to the right, that he understands,
or by a deflection to the left, that he does not understand,
and in the latter case the word is repeated.
In the early days of the Electric Telegraph, the
transmission of 40 letters a minute with the double
needle instrument was considered quick work; but
the practised clerks will now transmit one hundred
letters in that time, which is as fast as any person can
write with pen and ink.</p>

<p>Since the invention of the double and single
needle telegraphs there have been many modifications
in the instruments, to make them work more promptly
and with less vibration; but in all essential parts the
telegraphs of Messrs. Cooke and Wheatstone remain
unaltered, and continue to be generally used in this
country.</p>

<p>Of the numerous other telegraph instruments that
have been invented since 1837, that of Mr. Morse is
in most general use, especially on the Continent and
in America. Mr. Morse, indeed, claims to be the
first inventor of a practical Electric Telegraph; for,
according to his statement, he, in 1832, invented a
telegraph, which was in principle the same as the one
now in use. It was not, however, till September,
1838, that he made his instrument known in Europe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
by sending a description of it with a model to the
Academy of Sciences at Paris. Mr. Jackson, an
American, disputed with Mr. Morse for the honour
of the invention, and when the latter asserted that he
had described his telegraph in 1832, to some passengers
on board a packet-boat, Mr. Jackson affirmed
that it was he who described it on that occasion, and
that Mr. Morse, being present, got the idea from him.
It is painful and difficult to decide when we find two
claimants thus directly in opposition to each other,
and mutually preferring charges of falsehood and
fraud. The only safe guide in such cases is to refer
to the earliest published and authentic descriptions of
the inventions; and, following that guidance, the invention
of what is called Morse's telegraph must be
attributed to him whose name it bears; but we must,
according to the same rule, date it several years later
than 1832.</p>

<p>Mr. Morse's telegraph is a recording instrument,
that embosses the symbols upon paper, with a point
pressed down upon it by an electro-magnet. The
symbols that form the alphabet consist of combinations
of short and long strokes, which by their repetitions
and variations, are made to stand for different
letters. Thus a stroke followed by a dot signifies the
letter <i>A</i>; a stroke preceded by a dot, the letter <i>B</i>; a
single dot, the letter <i>E</i>; and in this manner the
whole alphabet is indicated, the number of repetitions
in no case exceeding four for each letter. The letters
and words are distinguished from one another by a
longer space being left between them than between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
each mark that forms only a part of a letter or of a
word. The annexed diagram represents the symbols
for the whole alphabet.</p>

<div id="ip_147" class="figcenter" style="width: 413px;"><img src="images/i_b_147.jpg" width="413" height="95" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>The mechanism of this telegraph instrument is
very simple. The transmitter is merely a spring key,
like that of a musical instrument, which, on being
pressed down, makes contact with the voltaic battery,
and sends an electric current to the receiving station.
The operator at the transmitting station, by thus
making contact, brings into action an electro-magnet
at the station he communicates with, and that pulls
down a point fixed to the soft iron lever upon a strip
of paper that is kept moving by clockwork slowly
under it. The duration of the pressure on the key,
whether instantaneous or prolonged for a moment, occasions
the difference in the lengths of the lines indented
on the paper. A single circuit is sufficient for this
telegraph, and a boy who is practised in the use of
the instrument will transmit nearly as many words in
a minute as can be sent by the double needle telegraph
with two wires.</p>

<p>The working of Mr. Morse's telegraph, it will be
observed, depends altogether upon bringing into
action at the receiving station an electro-magnet of
sufficient force to mechanically indent paper. Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
the resistance to the passage of electricity along the
wires diminishes the quantity transmitted so greatly,
that at long distances it would be almost impossible
to obtain sufficient power for the purpose, if it acted
directly. To overcome that difficulty, an auxiliary
electro-magnet is employed. The electro-magnet
which is directly in connection with the telegraph
wire is a small one, surrounded by about 500 yards
of very fine wire, for the purpose of multiplying as
much as possible the effect of the feeble current that
is transmitted. The soft iron keeper, which is attracted
by that magnet, is also very light, so that it
may be the more readily attracted. This highly sensitive
instrument serves to make and break contact
with a local battery, which brings into action a large
electro-magnet, and as the local battery and the magnet
are close to the place where the work is to be
done, any required force may be easily obtained. By
this means the marks may be impressed on the paper
at distances of 400 miles or more apart.</p>

<p>This is a very efficient and remarkably simple
telegraph, and as it operates with a single wire, it has
completely supplanted the needle telegraph on the
Continent; though the liability to error, common to
all manipulated telegraphs, is considerably increased
by this mode of transmission, nor can unintelligible
signals be indicated and corrected so readily as by
the needle instrument.</p>

<p>There have been several modifications of Mr.
Morse's telegraph, for the purpose of increasing the
rapidity of its action and the distinctness of the marks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
The most important of these was made by Mr. Bain,
who in 1847 applied for this purpose the method of
impressing the symbols on paper by electro-chemical
decomposition. Mr. Davy had, in 1843, taken out a
patent for the application of electro-chemical marks to
telegraphic purposes, but his method was not sufficiently
practical to be brought into use. Mr. Bain
adopted an alphabet of short and long strokes, similar
to that of Mr. Morse; but instead of making and
breaking contact by a key pressed down by the finger,
he punched holes in a strip of paper, corresponding
in lengths and positions to the marks intended to
be transmitted. A small metal spring, connected
with the voltaic battery, pressed upon a metal cylinder
attached to the telegraph wire, and when the
spring and cylinder touched, an electric current was
transmitted. The strip of punched paper was placed
upon the cylinder so as to interrupt the circuit, excepting
in the parts where the apertures allowed the
spring to make contact; therefore when the strip of
paper was moved along, an electric current was
transmitted through the apertures, and it was stopped
when the paper intervened. At the receiving station,
paper well moistened with a solution of prussiate
of potass and nitric acid was placed upon a corresponding
cylinder to receive the message, and a piece
of steel wire was kept steadily pressed upon it as it
moved along. The action of the electric current at
the parts where it was transmitted caused the acid to
enter into combination with the steel, and the consequent
deposition of iron on the paper was instantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
converted by the prussiate of potass into Prussian
blue. On the parts where the electric current was
interrupted no action took place, and thus numbers
of short and long marks were made on the paper, corresponding
to the lengths of the apertures on the prepared
message. A representation of the punched
paper for transmitting the word "Bain" is shown in
this diagram.</p>

<div id="ip_150" class="figcenter" style="width: 421px;"><img src="images/i_b_150.jpg" width="421" height="63" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>As electro-chemical action takes effect much more
rapidly than the mechanical movement of an indenting
point, Mr. Bain's telegraph could work much faster
than Mr. Morse's. We have been informed that as
many as 1,000 letters per minute have occasionally
been transmitted by this means from Manchester to
London. The disadvantage attending that mode of
transmission arises from the tedious process of punching
the message preparatory to transmission; and though
circumstances may arise in which it would be of great
importance to adopt this rapid system of transmission
with a single wire, it has been yet but little used in
this country by the Electric Telegraph Company, who
purchased Mr. Bain's patent for £10,000.</p>

<p>Another modification of Mr. Morse's telegraph,
which has been more extensively adopted in England,
consists in merely substituting marks made on paper
by electro-chemical decomposition for those indented
by pressure. It has been found desirable in practice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
however, to introduce an auxiliary electro-magnet,
called a "picker," for making and breaking contact,
by which arrangement the dotted marks can be made
by a local battery, and any required amount of electric
power be obtained. The marks produced in this
manner are more distinct, and are more quickly made,
than by mechanical pressure. By a more recent application
of Mr. Morse's system, the marks are made
on paper with ink flowing through a glass pen, in the
same manner as in the telegraph of M. Schweigger,
already noticed. As the strip of paper is moved
along, a continuous line is thus drawn on the paper.
When no signals are being transmitted the line is
straight, but when an electric current is sent through
the wire, it brings into action an electro-magnet,
which attracts the penholder on one side, and alters
the direction of the mark. The transmission is effected
by making and breaking contact with a key, and the
continuance of the divergence of the mark from its
normal direction is regulated by the duration of pressure
on the key. The symbols are thus made by deviations
from the straight line, of different lengths
and of varied combinations. Practical application
alone can determine whether this mode of making
the marks possesses any advantage over Mr. Morse's
original plan. The patent for this telegraph was
granted to Mr. Wilkins in 1854, but a similar instrument,
applied to the notation of astronomical observations,
was shown in the American department of the
Great Exhibition of 1851.</p>

<p>The recording telegraph instruments hitherto noticed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
impress on the paper only hieroglyphical symbols,
which require long practice to decipher readily.
It has, from the first practical application of the invention,
been considered highly desirable that the
letters of the alphabet should be indicated and printed
in their proper forms, so that the momentary transmission
of an electric current should leave behind a
durable impression that could be read without difficulty.
Professor Wheatstone and Mr. Bain separately
attempted to accomplish this desired object by the
invention of Printing Telegraphs, which print messages
from types. It is a question in dispute which of them
was the first to design a telegraph of this kind. In
1845, Mr. Bain had a printing telegraph in operation
experimentally on the South-Western Railway, for a
distance of seven miles, and we are not aware that
Professor Wheatstone ever succeeded in working his
printing instruments when separated at a distance
from each other. In principle, both inventions were
similar. A wheel, into the periphery of which were
inserted types of the twenty-six letters, was made to
rotate in close proximity to a piece of paper, over
which was placed a blackened surface that would
leave a mark on the paper when pressed upon.
When the required letter came opposite the paper,
the type-wheel was stopped and forced against it, so
that the letter was impressed, and the black from the
interposed surface marked the form of the type. The
paper was then moved forward to leave space for the
next letter, and thus a continuous message could be
printed. The objection to these instruments was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
uncertainty of stopping the type-wheel at the proper
point, so as to avoid printing wrong letters; and when
the instruments became thus irregular, they continued
so till they were again adjusted. This difficulty
has since been overcome; and by the combined
efforts of Mr. House in America, and of Messrs.
Brett in this country, the printing telegraph has attained
a high degree of perfection. The mechanical
arrangements of the instrument, though very complex,
consist essentially, like those of Mr. Bain and
Professor Wheatstone, in having a type-wheel, which,
by the action of the operator at the transmitting instrument
in making and breaking contact, moves or stops
at the required point, and the letters are printed by
forcing the paper against the type by an electro-magnet.
The movements of the type-wheel are regulated
by an electro-magnet, and one great improvement introduced
by Mr. Brett prevents the continuance of
error, should any be made during transmission, by
bringing the type-wheel to its first position after printing
each letter, so that if a wrong letter be printed,
the subsequent letters will not continue erroneous.
This printing telegraph works with a single wire, but
its operation is rather slow.</p>

<p>The last recording telegraph we shall notice is the
one invented by the author, which transmits copies
of the handwriting of correspondents. The communication
to be transmitted is written upon tin foil, thinly
coated with varnish, with a pen dipped in an ink composed
of caustic soda and colouring matter. The
alkali detaches the varnish, and when the surface is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
washed over with a wet sponge, the metal is exposed
on those parts written upon, the writing appearing
metallic on a dark ground. The message is then
placed round a metal cylinder that is connected with
the line wire from the receiving station. A brass
point, in connection with the voltaic battery, lightly
presses on the message as the cylinder rotates, so that
the electric circuit is made and broken through the
message as it passes under the connecting point, the
coating of varnish on the foil being sufficient to interrupt
the electric current in those parts where the
point is resting upon it. On a corresponding cylinder
in the electric circuit, at the receiving station, paper
moistened with a solution of prussiate of potass and
nitrate of soda is placed to receive the message; and
it is pressed upon by the point of a steel wire, in
connection with the communicating wire. The accompanying
diagram will assist in explaining the arrangement.</p>

<p>The cylinder of the instrument is shown at <i>a</i>; <i>b</i>
is the metal style connected by the wire <i>g</i> with one
of the poles of the voltaic battery; <i>o</i> is the arm which
holds the style and serves to insulate it from the rest
of the apparatus; <i>c</i> is a fine screw on which that arm
traverses as the cylinder revolves; <i>d d</i> are cog-wheels
to turn the screw. The speed of the instrument is
regulated by the fan <i>e</i>; <i>f</i> is the impelling weight,
and <i>h</i> the wire connected with the distant instrument.
The receiving and the transmitting instruments are
alike, the only difference between them being that
the style of the copying instrument is steel instead of
brass wire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span></p>

<div id="ip_155" class="figcenter" style="width: 299px;"><img src="images/i_b_155.jpg" width="299" height="369" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>As the cylinder <i>a</i> is connected by the wire <i>h</i> with
the distant instrument, and through it with one of
the poles of the voltaic battery, the electric circuit is
completed by passing from <i>g</i> through the tin foil
message, or through the paper placed on the cylinder.
This will be the case whenever the style of the transmitting
instrument is pressing on the metallic writing;
and at those times the electro-chemical action of the
voltaic current will produce a blue mark on the paper
of the receiving instrument, by the deposition of iron
and its combination with the prussiate of potass. The
circuit will in like manner be interrupted whenever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
the point <i>b</i> presses on those parts of the message where
the varnish is not removed; and thus, as the two cylinders
revolve, there will be a succession of small blue
marks on the parts where the writing allows the
electric current to pass. As the arms that carry the
points traverse on screws, they are drawn along as
the cylinders rotate, so as to press on fresh parts of
the message and of the paper at each revolution. The
steel point would therefore draw a series of spiral lines
on the paper, if the electric current were not interrupted;
but the interposition of the varnish breaks
those lines, and as the point passes over different portions
of the letters at each revolution of the cylinder,
the marks and the interruptions on the paper correspond
exactly with the forms of the letters, and thus
produce a copy of the writing placed upon the receiving
cylinder, in blue characters on a yellowish
ground. Or the message may be written on unprepared
tin foil with a pen dipped in varnish; in which
case the writing will be copied in white characters on
a ground of dark lines, as in the accompanying specimen,
<i>A</i> being the writing on tin foil, and <i>B</i> the message
received.</p>

<p>It is essential to the perfect working of the copying
telegraph that the corresponding instruments should
rotate exactly together. This is effected by an electromagnetic
regulator, which being put in action by one
instrument, governs the movements of the distant instrument
with the greatest exactness, as proved at a
distance of 300 miles.</p>

<p>It might be supposed, as the points must traverse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
several times over the same line of writing to copy
it, that the process is a slow one; but in consequence
of the rapidity with which the cylinders revolve, this
is not the case. The ordinary speed is one rotation
in two seconds, and at that rate three lines of writing,
containing sixty words, would be copied in one minute,
which is three times as fast as an expeditious
penman can write.</p>

<div id="ip_157" class="figcenter" style="width: 417px;"><img src="images/i_b_157.jpg" width="417" height="151" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>The advantages proposed to be gained by the copying
telegraph, in addition to its increased rapidity of
transmission, are the authentication of telegraphic
correspondence by the signatures of the writers, freedom
from the errors of transmission, and the maintenance
of secrecy. As a special means of obtaining
secrecy, the messages may be received on paper moistened
with a solution of nitrate of soda alone, in which
case they would be invisible until brushed over with
a solution of prussiate of potass, to be applied by the
person to whom the communication is addressed.</p>

<p>Professor Wheatstone has recently contrived an
improvement in his index telegraph, which was
described by Professor Faraday in a lecture at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
Royal Institution in June last. Its chief merit, however,
consists in the beauty of the mechanism, for
it is essentially the same as the index telegraphs he
and others have previously invented, with the substitution
of magneto-electricity for the moving force.</p>

<p>Having now traced the history of the invention of
the instruments by means of which messages may be
transmitted, it becomes necessary to describe the
methods employed for making the electrical connection
from one place to another. This part of the
electric telegraph system is, after all, the most essential
to its efficient working, and bears the same relation
to the transmitting instruments that the structure
of a railroad does to locomotive engines in the system
of railway conveyance.</p>

<p>The fact that an electric current might be sent
through a long circuit had been established by Dr.
Watson, in conjunction with other Fellows of the
Royal Society, in 1747, when they sent the charge of
a Leyden jar through two miles of wire, supported
upon short sticks driven into the ground; the wire at
each terminus being connected with the earth for the
return current. This method of insulation and conduction
fully answered the purpose, and served to determine
the great velocity with which electricity is
transmitted, for no perceptible interval occurred between
the discharge of the Leyden jar at one end of
the circuit, and its effect at the other extremity.</p>

<p>Mr. Ronalds made the next experiment on an extensive
scale, by insulating eight miles of wire in glass
tubes, the wire being carried backwards and forwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
for that distance on his lawn at Hammersmith. That
mode of insulation was found very efficient. It was,
indeed, too perfect, for the difficulty arose of discharging
the electricity from the wire after the charge had
passed through it.</p>

<p>The length of telegraphic communication established
at Munich, in 1837, by Dr. Steinheil, was an
important practical advance in the system of extending
and insulating the wires, and deserves consideration,
not only from the extent to which it was carried
into practical operation, but from the circumstance
that the earth was employed to form the return circuit.
The wires appear to have been carried through
the city by extending them from the church towers
and other elevated buildings. That plan, indeed, presents
so many facilities for passing telegraph wires
through towns, that it is not improbable it may be
ultimately adopted in this country.</p>

<p>Though the conducting power of the earth was
thus early made use of for one-half of the circuit, the
fact seems to have been unknown in England at the
time of laying down the telegraph wires to Slough in
1845, for a separate wire was then used for the return
current. Some years afterwards, indeed, Mr. Bain
laid claim to the discovery; but the fact that the conducting
power of the earth had been previously
applied to the purpose by Dr. Steinheil has been incontestably
proved.</p>

<p>In the early stages of the practical application of
electric telegraphs in this country, Mr. Cook took an
active part in overcoming the numerous difficulties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
attending the proper protection and insulation of the
wires. In the first instance, the plan of burying the
wires in trenches was
tried, but with very indifferent
success, as the asphaltum
and other resinous
substances with which
it was attempted to insulate
them were inadequate
for the purpose, and allowed
the electricity to escape
from wire to wire. The
method of supporting the
wires on tall posts was then
adopted by Mr. Cooke, the
wires being insulated from the posts at the points of
suspension, by passing them through quills. Various
improvements have since been made in the insulators,
and the plan most in favour at present is to pass the
wires through globular earthenware or glass insulators,
attached to the posts, as shown in the annexed
diagram. The wires themselves are about one-sixth
of an inch in diameter; they are made of iron coated
with zinc, or galvanized, as it is termed, to protect
them from rust.</p>

<div id="ip_160" class="figcenter" style="width: 205px;"><img src="images/i_b_160.jpg" width="205" height="259" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>Notwithstanding the great care taken to insulate
the wires at the posts, a large quantity of the electricity
escapes in wet weather, and returns to the battery
without having reached the most distant stations,
and thus not unfrequently the communications are
interrupted. The author is of opinion that the loss of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
electricity in wet weather is occasioned rather by
communication from one wire to another through the
moist atmosphere, than by defective insulation at the
posts. In confirmation of this opinion it may be
stated, that he has experimentally determined that a
working electric current might be transmitted from
London to Liverpool, if all the points of attachment
were connected by water with the surface of the
ground, provided that the rest of the wire were <span class="locked">insulated.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></span></p>

<p>The use of gutta percha as an insulating covering
for wire has given rise to a new era in telegraphic
communication. Gutta percha is an excellent insulator,
and wire covered with two coatings of that
material, about one-sixteenth of an inch each, is so far
protected, that 100 miles of it immersed in water
transmits an electric current from a powerful voltaic
battery with very trifling loss. This perfection in insulation
has greatly facilitated the establishment of
telegraphic communication between England and the
Continent. The first attempt to establish a submarine
circuit between Dover and Calais took place on the
28th of August, 1850. A single copper wire, about
the thickness of a common bell wire, coated thickly
with gutta percha, was laid across the English Channel
experimentally, without any protection. It proved
sufficient for the transmission of an electric current,
and several messages were sent through it between
Dover and Calais; but it was far too feeble to resist
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>the action of the waves, and the following day it was
cut through by friction against the rocks, and the
communication was stopped.</p>

<div id="ip_162" class="figcenter" style="width: 413px;"><img src="images/i_b_162.jpg" width="413" height="122" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>The plan afterwards adopted for a permanent submarine
line was to enclose five similar wires in a
hollow iron wire cable. The wires were first slightly
twisted, to prevent them from being broken when
stretched. They were then covered with hempen
yarn, to protect the gutta percha from attrition, and
they were thus introduced into the hollow cable, of
which they formed the core. The accompanying
woodcut represents this structure of the cable; the
five twisted wires are shown at <i>C</i>; <i>B</i> represents the
same covered with hemp yarn; and <i>A</i> a portion of
the completed cable, constructed of thick iron wire
galvanized. This cable has now been laid down for
seven years, and with perfect success. Its strength
has often been severely tested, as it has been sometime
drawn up by ships' anchors, and considerably
strained; but it has not been broken, and the insulation
is almost perfect. The success of this submarine
cable has induced the extension of that means of communicating
with the Continent, and similar submarine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
telegraph cables have been laid down from Dover
to Ostend, from Harwich to the Hague, from Scotland
to Ireland, and across the Mediterranean Sea as far
as Malta. The weight and the cost of those cables
present a serious obstacle to their adoption in forming
a telegraphic communication with America; and
when it was determined to attempt to establish electrical
connection with the New World, a different
form of cable was adopted. The conductor of the
electric current in the Atlantic cable is
composed of seven strands of fine copper
wire twisted together, the aggregate thickness
of which is not greater than the single
copper wire of other submarine cables. This fine
copper cord is covered carefully with gutta percha;
it is then coated with tarred hemp, and is protected
externally by an iron wire rope, composed of numerous
strands of fine wire. The form and exact size of
the cable are shown in the accompanying drawing
and section. The central dots in the section are the
conducting wires round which are the gutta percha
and hemp, and the outer rim represents the iron wire
casing.</p>

<div id="ip_163" class="figcenter" style="width: 395px;"><img src="images/i_b_163.jpg" width="395" height="80" alt="" /><br /></div>

<div id="ip_163b" class="figcenter" style="width: 80px;"><img src="images/i_b_163b.jpg" width="80" height="80" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>The successful laying down of so frail a cable, after
many failures, affords good ground for hoping that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
with the experience already gained, subsequent efforts
will prove more satisfactory and much less expensive
than this first attempt to establish telegraphic communication
with America. The most questionable
part of the problem has, indeed, been already solved;
for the transmission of electric signals, through that
length of submerged wire, was at one time doubted;
and though the communication through the present
cable has ceased, it has sufficiently established the
fact, that telegraphic communication with America is
a practicable undertaking.</p>

<p>The excellent insulation obtained by means of
gutta percha covered wires has caused a return to the
original plan of burying the wires in trenches in the
ground. The British and Submarine Telegraph Company
make all their communications by that means;
the number of coated wires required being enclosed in
iron tubes, and laid in the ground along the common
roads. That plan is, however, attended with considerable
disadvantages. In the first place, the cost of the
coated copper wire is more than quadruple that of
galvanized iron wire; and though copper, compared
with iron, offers only one-seventh part the resistance
to the transmission of electricity, yet the thin wire
employed is scarcely equal in conducting power to the
galvanized iron wire usually supported on posts. The
quantity of electricity transmitted is therefore less, and
the comparative intensity of it is greater.</p>

<p>Another difficulty attending the use of insulated
wires buried in the ground arises from a very peculiar
condition of electrical conduction, that could scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
have been anticipated. The wire, coated with gutta
percha, and surrounded externally with water or with
moist earth, becomes an elongated Leyden jar; the
gutta percha representing the glass, the wire the inside
coating, and the water the conducting surface
outside. Thus, when electricity is transmitted through
such a medium, a portion of the charge is retained
after connection with the battery has been broken.
This effect increases with the length of the wire and
the intensity of the current; and it materially interferes
with the working of many telegraph instruments.
In some experiments with the copying telegraph at
the Gutta Percha Works in the City Road, it was
found that through a circuit of 50 miles of wire immersed
in water, the mark made by electro-chemical
decomposition on paper had a tendency to become
continuous; so that instead of ceasing to mark, when
the varnish interrupted the current, a line was drawn
continuously on the paper, though the stronger marks
where the current passed were sufficient to make the
writing legible. The retention of the charge was also
shown still more remarkably by the explosion of gunpowder
by the electricity retained in the wire half a
minute after connection with the battery had been
broken. It is owing to the retention of the electricity
by the wire that the slowness with which the messages
through the Atlantic cable were transmitted is
to be attributed, and not to the length of the cable.
The rate of one word a minute was the average speed
of transmission when the first messages were sent
through the wire. The effect of the <i>retardation</i> of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
electric current is comparatively insignificant and were
it not for the peculiar action of the surrounding water,
the messages might have been transmitted twelve
times faster than they were.</p>

<p>The cost of constructing a telegraphic line has
greatly diminished with the increased facilities of insulating
the wires, and since the expiration of patents,
which conferred a monopoly on certain plans of doing
so. The cost to the Great Western Railway Company
for a line of six wires to Slough, was £150 per mile,
with comparatively low and slender posts and very
imperfect insulation. The cost of the same number
of wires at the present day would not be one-half that
sum, with thicker wires and better insulation.</p>

<p>It is customary in England to restrict the suspension
of telegraphic wires to railways, from the notion
that the protection of railways is necessary to prevent
wilful damage to the wires; and as the Electric Telegraph
Company have made exclusive arrangements
with all the railway companies out of London, the
competing telegraph companies have preferred to lay
their wires underground rather than incur the supposed
risk of damage to the wires if suspended from
posts on common roads, though by this means the cost
of construction is at least quadrupled. The protection
which railways afford is, however, more imaginary
than real, for any one inclined to interrupt the communication
could easily do so; and if on common
roads proper precautions were taken in fixing the posts,
and a heavy penalty were imposed on wilful offenders,
the common roads and open fields would, there can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
be little doubt, offer as safe a course for the telegraphic
wires as railways.</p>

<p>The conducting power of the earth is now employed
by all electric telegraph companies for one-half
of every circuit. Thus, whether a communication be
sent from London to Liverpool, to Edinburgh, Paris,
or Brussels, the moist earth serves to complete one-half
of the communication. In the telegraphic circuit between
London and Liverpool, for example, the insulated
wire is connected at each end with the earth
by being soldered to a copper plate, which is buried
a few feet underground, so as to insure its being
always surrounded with moisture. To improve the
connection of this plate with the earth, it is customary
to bury with it a quantity of sulphate of copper, the
solution of which surrounds the earth-plate with a
better conducting liquid than water, and thus extends
the connecting surface. The gas pipes or water pipes
are sometimes employed for the attachment of the
wires instead of an earth-plate, but the latter is generally
preferred.</p>

<p>In arranging a telegraphic circuit, the voltaic
batteries and the instruments are introduced at breaks
in the telegraph wire. The course of the electric current
is from the copper end of the battery through the
transmitting instrument, then along the wire to the
receiving instrument; from that it passes to the earth
and is thus returned to the transmitting station, where
it completes the circuit by being conducted from the
earth-plate to the zinc end of the voltaic battery. The
arrangement for completing the circuit will be more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
clearly understood by reference to the accompanying
diagram.</p>

<div id="ip_168" class="figcenter" style="width: 434px;"><img src="images/i_b_168.jpg" width="434" height="98" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>The wire from <i>C</i>, which is the copper pole of the
voltaic battery, is connected with the instrument <i>A</i>;
the electric current is then transmitted along the wire
<i>D</i> to the receiving instrument <i>B</i>; thence it is transferred
to the earth-plate <i>E</i>, passes through the earth to
the corresponding plate <i>E´</i>, which is connected with
<i>Z</i>, the zinc pole of the battery. When a communication
is returned from <i>B</i> to <i>A</i>, a similar arrangement
is made; the wires connected with the instruments
being so arranged as to bring into action a voltaic
battery at <i>B</i>, and to throw out of circuit the one at
<i>A</i>; for the connection with the battery is only made
when the transmitting instrument is worked.</p>

<p>Since all the electric telegraphs in different parts
of the world are connected with the earth, as one portion
of the circuit, it might be supposed that the
various currents would mingle, and occasion a confusion
of messages; but it must be borne in mind that
no electric current is formed until a communication be
made from one pole of a voltaic battery to the other,
and as such communication can only be completed
through the insulated wire, the earth-currents cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
mingle, but each one passes to the proper terminus of
its respective battery. The accompanying diagram
and explanation may serve to remove the difficulty of
understanding why the two circuits are maintained
quite distinct.</p>

<div id="ip_169" class="figcenter" style="width: 436px;"><img src="images/i_b_169.jpg" width="436" height="105" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>The letters <i>A</i> <i>B</i> represent the wires making communications
between the batteries <i>D</i> and <i>E</i>, and the
telegraph instruments <i>I</i> <i>O</i> at the receiving station.
The electricity from the copper end of the battery <i>D</i>
would be conducted along <i>A</i> through the instrument
<i>I</i>, and by the wire <i>K</i> to the earth-plate <i>H</i>. It would
be then transmitted through the earth on its return to
the battery, in the direction of the arrows, to the other
earth-plate <i>G</i>, and thence it would find its way to the
zinc pole of the battery <i>D</i>, and complete the circuit.
In the same manner, the electric current from the
copper end of the battery <i>E</i> would be transmitted
through the wire <i>B</i>, and would complete its current
also by means of the earth-plates <i>G</i> <i>H</i>, and would
traverse the course indicated by the arrows, and return
to the zinc end of <i>E</i>. Though both electric
currents traverse the same wire from the instruments
<i>I</i> <i>O</i> to the earth-plate <i>H</i>, and are thence transmitted
through the earth to a single plate, <i>G</i>, at the transmitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
station, there is no mingling of currents, the
electric current of each battery being kept as distinct
as if separate wires were used both for the transmitted
and the return current. It would, indeed, be as impossible
for the separate currents transmitted from the
two batteries to be mingled together, as it would be
for the written contents of two letters enclosed in the
same mail-bag to <span class="locked">intermix.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></span></p>

<p>The length of telegraph lines at present laid down
by the several telegraph companies in Great Britain,
exceeds 10,000 miles. To complete those lines required
40,000 miles of wire, and there are 3,000 persons
engaged in the transmission of telegraphic
intelligence.</p>

<p>In North America there is a direct communication
from New York to New Orleans, a distance of 2,000
miles, through the whole length of which wires
messages can be transmitted without any break.
Wires have also been suspended on lofty posts across
the Indian Peninsula, where no railways have been
yet laid down. Lines of insulated wire, partly submerged
in the sea, partly buried underground, and
partly suspended on posts in the air, place London
and Vienna in direct communication; and other telegraph
lines are in the course of construction, which
will unite London with Africa: and a complete net-work
of telegraph wires is spreading over the face of
Europe.</p>

<p>It will not be long before this system of communication<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
is connected with a similar one in America.
The failure of the cable already laid down has confirmed
the opinion of the author, expressed in papers
read at meetings of the British Association for the
Advancement of Science, and in his work on Electricity,
that the conducting wire should be sufficiently
strong to be self-protective, without requiring an external
coating of iron wire rope. A conducting copper
wire, a quarter of an inch in diameter, covered
with gutta percha and tarred hemp, would be more
flexible and stronger than the combined cable; and
it being a much better conductor of electricity, the
rapidity of transmission would be greatly increased.</p>

<p>The effect of the establishment of competing telegraph
companies in England has been to diminish the
charge for transmitting messages, in some instances
to one-fifth of the rate formerly demanded; and
when further experience in the construction of telegraphic
lines, and the adoption of more rapidly transmitting
instruments, have facilitated and improved
the means of communication, we may anticipate that
correspondence by Electric Telegraph will in a great
measure supersede the transmission of letters by post.</p>

<h2><a name="ELECTRO-MAGNETIC_CLOCKS" id="ELECTRO-MAGNETIC_CLOCKS">ELECTRO-MAGNETIC CLOCKS.</a></h2>

<p>The invention of Electro-Magnetic Clocks closely
followed the introduction of the electric telegraph;
and Professor Wheatstone, to whom the world is
principally indebted, in conjunction with Mr. Cooke,
for the perfection and application of the needle telegraphic
instrument, claims also to be the original inventor
of Electro-Magnetic Clocks. His claim is,
however, disputed by Mr. Bain, who asserts that he
was the first who conceived the idea of applying the
power of electro-magnets to the regulation and movements
of clocks, and it must be admitted that he
brought the invention into a working state.</p>

<p>In the first stage of the invention, the object attempted
to be attained was to regulate several clocks,
once an hour&mdash;or oftener, if required&mdash;so that they
might all indicate precisely the same time. For
this purpose Mr. Bain took for a standard time-keeper
a clock of the best possible construction, placed in
circumstances favourable to maintaining accuracy.
The minute-hand of his clock, the instant that it
pointed to the hour, made connection with a voltaic
battery that brought into action a series of electro-magnets
attached to the clocks to be regulated; one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
of them being fixed on the top of each clock. Its
momentary action was made to collapse a pair of
clippers, which in closing seized the minute-hand of
the clock to which it was attached, and brought it to
the hour point. Thus all the clocks in the series
could be regulated every hour, for the collapse of
the clippers pushed the hand forward if it were too
late, or thrust it back if it had gained. Mr. Bain
contemplated the application of this contrivance to
all the public clocks of a town, by having wires laid
down in the streets to connect them in one voltaic
circuit. Such a plan would, however, have involved
greater expense and trouble in its accomplishment
than the object seemed to merit; but the regulation
of any number of clocks in a large establishment
might have been practicable by that means. We are
not aware, however, that this mode of regulating
clocks by electricity was ever adopted, and it has
since been superseded by an arrangement made by
Mr. Shepherd, junior, to be presently noticed.</p>

<p>Improving on this first application of electro-magnetism
to the regulation of clocks, Mr. Bain
afterwards employed the power to keep the clocks
in action, so that each clock might be propelled by
magnets alone, without any weight, and without the
ordinary train of wheels.</p>

<p>Every one acquainted with the mechanism of a
clock is aware that the weight communicates motion
to a train of wheels, and that the movement is regulated
by the vibration of a pendulum, which is acted
on by the last wheel of the train. That wheel, called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
the escapement, is so formed, that each tooth catches
in succession into a detent fixed on the pendulum
near the point of suspension, which allows one tooth
to pass at each double vibration. The pendulum,
therefore, governs the movement of the train of
wheels by checking the escapement, and allowing
the teeth to pass one by one; and as pendulums of
given lengths vibrate in given times, if their actions
be not interfered with, the clocks will keep regular
time. But the pressure of the escape-wheel against
the detent, and the consequent friction, prevent the
pendulum from acting freely. In the best made
clocks there are special contrivances to detach the
pendulum as much as possible from the wheels, and
likewise to compensate for variations in the length
of the pendulum by change of temperature.</p>

<p>In the clocks actuated by electro-magnetism, the
movement of the pendulum is not maintained by
repeated impulses of the escape-wheel, as in ordinary
clocks, but by magnetic attraction; an electro-magnet
being so arranged as to attract the bob of the
pendulum in both directions alternately. In Mr.
Bain's arrangement, the bob of the pendulum is
formed of a hollow coil of covered copper wire,
which, on the transmission of an electric current,
becomes magnetic, and it is then attracted by several
permanent magnets fixed in a hollow horizontal bar,
over which the coil of wire moves. The accompanying
diagram will serve to explain more clearly the
parts of the clock on which the movement of the
pendulum depends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
The pendulum rod, <i>B</i>, is made of wood, and the
bob, <i>A</i>, consists of a hollow coil of thick copper wire
covered with cotton, through which the hollow bar,
<i>C C</i>, passes. Inside that bar there are several permanent
magnets, packed on each side of the ends of the
coil of wire, the poles of those on one side being the
opposite of those on the other. In the diagram only
one magnet on each side
is represented, <i>n</i> and <i>s</i>, to
prevent confusion. The ends
of the coil of wire are attached
to the pendulum rod,
and they are conducted up
it so as to form connection
with the wires of the voltaic
battery, which are connected
with gold studs inserted into
a horizontal stage fixed to
the clock-case. A small
movable bridge, formed of
wire, and having the ends tipped with gold or platinum,
rests upon the stage, and is shifted from side to
side by the pendulum. In these movements the gold
points touch and slide over the gold studs in the stage,
and thereby make and break contact with the voltaic
battery, and alternately send and interrupt an electric
current through the coil of wire.</p>

<div id="ip_175" class="figcenter" style="width: 192px;"><img src="images/i_b_175.jpg" width="192" height="257" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>Suppose, for instance, that the pendulum is about
to rise to the right towards <i>s</i>, at which time the
voltaic circuit is completed. The coil is, therefore,
magnetic, and is attracted by the permanent magnet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
in <i>C</i>. As the pendulum approaches the end of its
swing, it pushes the movable bridge away from the
gold studs on which it rests, and thus breaks connection
with the voltaic battery, and the pendulum
descends unrestrained by the attractive force of the
magnets. As the pendulum descends towards its
lowest point, it shifts the bridge on to the metal studs
on the other side, which are so disposed as to send
a current through the coil in a direction opposite to
the former, so that the poles of the voltaic battery are
reversed, and the attractive force is exerted in drawing
the pendulum towards the left hand. In this
manner the power imparted to the coil, as the pendulum
vibrates to and fro, produces a continuous
repetition of the attraction on each side alternately,
and maintains a constant action.</p>

<p>The only wheels required in a clock of this kind
are those which turn the hands; and the motion is
communicated from the pendulum to the seconds
wheel by means of a small attached lever, working
on a ratchet wheel. The minute and the hour hands
derive their movements from the seconds wheel in
the usual manner.</p>

<p>The voltaic battery employed to work Mr. Bain's
clocks consists of a pair of large copper and zinc
plates buried in the moist earth, which excite a sufficient
amount of electricity to maintain the motion of
the pendulum. A battery of this kind will remain in
action a long time, and will serve to keep a clock
going for several months. It is, indeed, a near
approach to the attainment of perpetual motion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
since nothing but the wearing away of the materials,
or the accumulation of dust on the connecting points,
seems to prevent the realization of that mechanical
chimera.</p>

<p>There is a disadvantage attending the arrangement
of Mr. Bain's clocks, arising from the attachment of
the pendulum to the wheels; and as the moving force
is derived directly from voltaic electricity, any variation
in the power of the battery causes variation in
the lengths of the vibrations, and produces irregularity.
For the purpose of remedying these defects, Mr. Shepherd,
junior, has adopted an arrangement which detaches
the pendulum from the clock movement, and
makes its vibrations altogether independent of the
varying force of voltaic batteries.</p>

<p>In Mr. Shepherd's arrangement, the impulse of
the pendulum is given by successive blows from a
spring, which is drawn back and then liberated at
each vibration. The hands of the clock are also moved
by electro-magnets, by which means the impelling
forces and the resistances encountered by the pendulum
are always constant. By making the pendulum thus
independent of the works, and employing it merely to
make and break contract at regular intervals, any
number of clocks in the same establishment may be
set in motion, and kept exactly together, by a single
pendulum.</p>

<p>The large clock over the principal entrance to the
Great Exhibition was on this construction. It would
have been impossible, with any approach to regularity,
to have moved hands of that size, exposed as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
were to the wind, unless the pendulum had been independent
of such resistances.</p>

<p>Electro-Magnetic Clocks have not yet come into
general use, partly owing to imperfections in the battery
connections, which occasionally put a stop to
their movements, but principally on account of the
high prices charged by the patentees. As no trains
of wheels are requisite in an Electro-Magnetic Clock,
it might be manufactured very cheaply; and when
the price is reduced to its proper standard, and the
trifling practical defects are remedied, these clocks
may possibly supersede others.</p>

<h2><a name="ELECTRO-METALLURGY" id="ELECTRO-METALLURGY">ELECTRO-METALLURGY.</a></h2>

<p>The electrotype, electro-gilding and plating, and
the other applications of the deposition of metals
from their solutions, by the agency of voltaic electricity,
had their origin in the chance observation of
peculiarities in frequently repeated experiments. In
this, as in most other inventions, there are contending
claimants for priority; but there is little merit due to
any of the first discoverers of the process, who seem
to have been guided altogether by accident. It seems
strange, now, on observing the extensive use that is
made of the deposition of metals, that it should have
remained so long unapplied after the principle had
been known.</p>

<p>The "revivification," as it was called, of metals
from their solutions by voltaic electricity, was known
at the beginning of the present century; for, in 1805,
Brugnatelli, an Italian chemist, gilded a silver medal
by connecting it with the negative pole of a voltaic
battery, when immersed in a solution of ammoniuret
of gold. It did not occur to him, however, that any
use could be made of that mode of gilding, and the
experiment had no result.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
Nothing further was done, even experimentally,
towards advancing the art of electrotyping, until Mr.
Spencer, of Liverpool, when experimenting with a
Daniell's battery, in 1837, accidentally coated a penny
piece with copper; and when the thin sheet of metal
was removed, he found on it an exact counterpart of
the head and letters of the coin. Even this did not
suggest any useful application; nor was it until, by a
further accident, a drop of varnish fell on the copper
of the negative pole, and showed that no deposition
took place on the part so covered, that the idea occurred
to him of turning the deposition of the copper
to account. The method he adopted of doing so was
to cover a copper plate with varnish or wax, and to
etch a design through the covering. By then exposing
the plate to the action of a solution of sulphate of
copper, when in connection with the negative pole of
a voltaic battery, the metal was deposited in the lines
drawn through the varnish, and a design in relief was
fixed to the copper. This slight advance in the art was
not made known until it was announced, in 1839, that
Professor Jacobi, of St. Petersburg, had made application
of the same process. Mr. Spencer, indeed, was
forestalled, even in this country, by Mr. Jordan, a
printer, who published an account in the <i>Mechanics'
Magazine</i> for May, 1839, of a method of making copper
casts by the deposition of copper from its solution.
In the autumn of the same year, however, Mr. Spencer
exhibited to the British Association several more
perfect specimens of electrotyping, that showed the
process might be rendered valuable; and from that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
time rapid progress was made in bringing it into practical
operation in a variety of ways.</p>

<p>The deposition of copper from its solution, when
under the action of voltaic electricity, is not produced
by the decomposition of the sulphate of copper, as
might be supposed, but by the decomposition of the
water that acts as the solvent of the metallic salt.
Thus, when two platinum wires from the poles of a
voltaic battery are introduced into acidulated water,
hydrogen gas is disengaged at the wire connected
with the negative pole, and oxygen at the other; but
when a solution of sulphate of copper is substituted
for water, the hydrogen that is disengaged combines
with the oxygen that held the copper in solution, and
the metal is liberated. The copper thus liberated
from its combination with the oxygen is deposited, in
a pure metallic state, on the surface connected with
the negative pole of the battery.</p>

<p>The simplest illustration of electro-metallic deposition
is obtained by immersing a silver spoon and a
strip of zinc into a solution of sulphate of copper. So
long as the two metals are kept apart, no change
takes place on the silver, but on bringing them into
contact, voltaic action immediately commences, and
a coating of copper is deposited upon the spoon, and
adheres firmly to the metal. If the action be continued,
and the supply of copper be maintained by
the addition of fresh crystals of the sulphate, the coat
of copper may be increased in thickness to almost
any extent.</p>

<p>The first applications of the discovery were directed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
to the copying of medals and coins. An impression
of the metal was obtained in fusible metal, which is
an alloy composed of tin, lead, and bismuth, melted
together in the proportions of two of the latter to one
each of the former. This alloy expands on cooling,
and thus affords a very sharp impression of the medals;
and as it melts at a low temperature, it may be easily
removed after the copper coating has been deposited
upon it.</p>

<p>An electrotype mould, obtained directly from the
medal, is, however, more sharp in its definition than
an impression, and is therefore preferable, when circumstances
admit of its being so taken. For that purpose,
the surface whereon the deposition is to be made
is smeared over with sweet oil, or with black lead. It
is then carefully wiped with cotton wool, but a minute
quantity of the oil will still remain, sufficient to prevent
the metal from adhering.</p>

<p>A simple form of apparatus for the electrotype
process is shown in the accompanying diagram.</p>

<p>An earthenware jar, <i>a</i>, serves to hold the solution
of copper, which should be maintained in a saturated
state by the addition of crystals of the salt. A porous
tube, <i>b</i>, holds a rod of amalgamated zinc, to the top
of which a binding-screw is soldered. The copper
mould or medal, <i>c</i>, is suspended in the solution by a
wire, which is held tight by the binding-screw, <i>d</i>.
The porous jar is then filled to the same height as the
copper solution in the jar with diluted sulphuric acid,
in the proportions of one of acid to twenty of water.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
Voltaic action immediately
commences, and the copper
will continue to be deposited
from the solution as long as
the supply of fresh crystals
of sulphate of copper is continued.
In about twenty-four
hours the coating of copper
will be as thick as a thin
card, and it may be then removed.
When detached from
the medal, it will be found to
be an exact counterpart, in
the minutest details, of the
original; those parts of the
medal which are in relief being, of course, the reverse
in the mould.</p>

<div id="ip_183" class="figcenter" style="width: 163px;"><img src="images/i_b_183.jpg" width="163" height="314" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>The extreme minuteness and delicacy of the electrotype
process is strikingly exemplified in its application
to the transference of engraved copper-plates.
A highly finished engraved copper-plate has a film
of metal deposited over its whole surface, which, when
detached, exhibits all the lines that are cut into the
copper-plate in relief. That electrotype cast then
serves as the mould for further depositions, in which
every line in the original engraving is so perfectly developed,
that it is impossible to detect a difference in
the impressions taken from the two plates. By this
means any number of casts may be made and worked
from, whilst the original is preserved uninjured. The
objection to this application is that the metal deposited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
is not so hard as the hammered plates, and will
not, therefore, bear the wear and tear of copper-plate
printing so well as the plates made by hand.</p>

<p>It was at one time supposed that the depositing of
metal on surfaces, by voltaic action, might be applied
to the manufacture of numerous kinds of copper
articles without manual labour. For this purpose,
casts were made of plaster of Paris, which were
covered with black lead, to give them the property
of conducting electricity, and the metal was then deposited
upon them. But, independently of the practical
difficulties attending the operation, it was found
that the metal was not sufficiently hard, and the cost
of the requisite voltaic batteries rendered the economy
of the process questionable.</p>

<p>One of the successful applications of Electro-Metallurgy
is founded on the original application of it by
Mr. Spencer. As already stated, he covered metal
plates with wax, and after scratching through the
coating, and exposing the metal, he submitted the
plate to voltaic action in a solution of sulphate of
copper, and thus obtained a representation, in relief,
of the figures cut through the wax; but he does not
seem to have thought of the application of this mode
of deposition, since adopted, by which engravings in
relief are obtained, and printed from with the ordinary
letter-press, in the same manner as woodcuts.
The name given to this new art is "Glyphography,"
and it is used with great advantage when the effect
of copper-plate engraving is required; for cross lines,
which are difficult to cut in wood, can be worked by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
this method with as great facility as in copper-plate
etching.</p>

<p>Another application of Electro-Metallurgy that
promises to be useful, is the coating of glass and earthenware
vessels with copper, so as to enable them to
be placed over the fire without being cracked. A
glass sauce-pan might thus be made, which, protected
by metal covering, would neither break nor
crack when placed upon the fire, because the metal
would diffuse the heat over the whole surface, and
prevent the unequal expansion of the vessel, which is
the cause of the cracking of glass and earthenware
when placed upon the fire. A patent was granted
last year for a mode of coating earthenware vessels
with copper or iron by electro-chemical deposition.
The earthenware is first covered either with copper
leaf or with bronze powder, to obtain an electrical
conducting surface on which the copper can be deposited,
and the vessel is then placed in a solution of
sulphate of copper, and put in connection with the
negative pole of a voltaic battery.</p>

<p>The electrotype is frequently applied with advantage
to the preservation and multiplication of objects
of art and natural productions, for even the forms of
flowers may be in this manner rendered durable; but
the most important use that has been made of the
process is in plating and gilding. To effect that object,
it is necessary to employ a voltaic battery separated
from the vessel in which the decomposition
takes place. The annexed diagram shows an arrangement
of this kind. A single cell of a Daniell's battery,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
<i>a</i>, is connected by wires from its positive and
negative poles, with metal rods placed across the
decomposition cell, <i>b</i>. The articles to be plated are
suspended by wires from the metal rod, <i>f</i>, and a plate
of silver is attached to the rod, <i>e</i>. Thus, when the
vessel is filled with the silvering liquid, a voltaic current
is established, and the deposition is effected on
the articles connected with the negative pole.</p>

<div id="ip_186" class="figcenter" style="width: 368px;"><img src="images/i_b_186.jpg" width="368" height="178" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>The menstruum best adapted for electro-plating is
a solution of silver in cyanide of potassium. During
the process of deposition, the same quantity of metal
that is deposited from the liquid on the objects connected
with the negative pole of the battery is restored
to it, by dissolving an equal quantity from
the silver plate connected with the positive pole, and
in this manner the solution is maintained at the same
strength. Any thickness of silver may be deposited
by continuing the process, but about one ounce and a
half to a square foot of surface is considered a full
quantity. Those parts on which no silver is required
to be deposited are covered with varnish or wax, which
protects them from the voltaic action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
Where the operation of electro-plating is carried
on extensively, decomposing troughs, holding nearly
300 gallons, are employed, and the silver plates in a
single trough expose a surface of thirty square feet to
the dissolving action of the menstruum under the influence
of the voltaic battery.</p>

<p>By the aid of electro-plating the most elaborate
designs of the artist in metal can be covered with silver
on every part; and a group, finely engraved in
copper, may be made to resemble in every particular
a work cut out of solid silver. The metal is usually
deposited in a granulated state, resembling "frosted"
silver, and the parts required to be bright are subsequently
burnished; but by the addition of a few drops
of the sulphuret of carbon to the solution, the silver
may be precipitated perfectly bright.</p>

<h2><a name="GAS_LIGHTING" id="GAS_LIGHTING">GAS LIGHTING.</a></h2>

<p>The invention of Gas Lighting had its origin in the
earliest times of history; not, indeed, as we now see
it, burning at the end of a pipe supplied with gas
made artificially, and stored in gas-holders, but blazing
from fissures in the ground, supplied from natural
sources in the bowels of the earth. The Greek fire-altars
are supposed to have been supplied with gas,
either issuing from bituminous beds, or made artificially
by the priests, by pouring oil on heated stones
placed in cavities beneath. Fountains of naphtha, and
fires issuing from the earth at Ecbatana, in Media, are
mentioned by Plutarch in his life of Alexander, and
many other ancient historians record the knowledge
of similar instances of natural gas lighting.</p>

<p>In later times, the inflammable gas issuing into the
galleries of coal mines, and either exploding when
mixed with atmospheric air, or blazing as it issued
from fissures in the coal, afforded instances of the
natural production of gas, the ignition of which too
frequently proved fatal to those in the mines.</p>

<p>A remarkable instance of the issue of inflammable
gas into the shaft of a coal mine at Whitehaven,
which produced a blaze about 3 feet diameter and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
6 feet long, is noticed in the "Philosophical Transactions"
of 1733. The part whence the gas issued
was vaulted off, and a tube was inserted into the
cavity and carried to the top of the pit, where it
escaped in undiminished quantity for years, and
lighted the country for a distance of several miles.
Many experiments were made with this large issue
of gas, and it was proposed to conduct it in pipes
to Whitehaven, to light the streets of that town, but
the proposition was rejected by the local authorities.</p>

<p>In China, naturally produced gas is used on a
large scale, and was so long before the knowledge
of its application was acquired by Europeans. Beds
of coal, lying at a great depth, are frequently pierced
by the borers for salt water, and from these wells the
inflammable gas springs up. It sometimes appears
as a jet of fire from 20 to 30 feet high; and, in the
neighbourhood of Thsee-Lieon-Teing, the salt works
were formerly heated and lighted by means of these
fountains of fire. Bamboo pipes carry the gas from
the spring to the places where it is intended to be
consumed. These canes are terminated by tubes of
pipe-clay, to prevent their being burnt, and other
bamboo canes conduct the gas intended for lighting
the streets, and into large apartments and kitchens.
Thus Nature presents in these positions a complete
establishment of gas-light <span class="locked">works.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></span></p>

<p>Though the production of illuminating gas from
natural sources had been thus long known, the idea of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>distilling it artificially from coal, for the purpose of
illumination, did not occur until the end of the last
century. Dr. Clayton, indeed, nearly arrived at the
practical application of carburretted hydrogen, in
1737, for he instituted experiments to prove that coal
contains gas, nearly similar to that of the "fire
damp" in coal mines, and that it burns with a bright
flame. At that time, however, the nature of gases
was so imperfectly known, that he was unable to do
more than discover that coal possesses the property
of giving out, when heated, gas that will burn with
a bright light.</p>

<p>In the "Philosophical Transactions" of 1739, Dr.
Clayton thus describes the effect of the "spirit of
coal," obtained by destructive distillation in an iron
retort. "I kept this spirit," he says, "in bladders
for a considerable time, and endeavoured several
ways to condense it, but in vain; and when I had a
mind to divert strangers or friends, I have frequently
taken one of these bladders, and pierced a hole in it
with a pin, and, compressing gently the bladder near
the flame of a candle till it once took fire, it would
then continue flaming till all the spirit was compressed
out of the bladder; which was the more
surprising, because no one could discern any
difference in the appearance between these bladders
and those which were filled with common air."</p>

<p>The first known application of coal gas to illumination
was made, in 1792, by Mr. William Murdoch,
engineer at the Soho manufactory, to whose great
ingenuity the world is also indebted for the invention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
of the first plan of a steam locomotive <span class="locked">engine.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></span> He
was at that time occupied in superintending the
fitting up of steam engines for the Cornish mines,
and his attention having been directed to the properties
of gas issuing from coal, he instituted a series of
experiments on carburretted hydrogen, the practical
result of which was the lighting of his house and
offices, at Redruth, with coal gas. The mines at
which Mr. Murdoch worked being some miles distant
from his house, he was in the constant practice of
filling a bladder with coal gas, in the neck of which
he fixed a metallic tube with a small orifice, through
which the gas issued. The lighted gas issuing
through the tube served as a lantern to light his way;
and as he thus proceeded along the road with the
light issuing from the bladder, the country people
looked upon him as a wizard.</p>

<p>The gas was generated by Mr. Murdoch in an
iron retort, and collected in a common gasometer,
from which it was conducted in pipes to the rooms
to be lighted. He also, in an early stage of the invention,
contrived a means for making the gas
portable, by compressing it into strong vessels; a
plan which, a few years since, was adopted by the
Portable Gas Company in London.</p>

<p>Mr. Murdoch having proved the practicability of
illumination by gas generated from coal, he continued
his experiments to facilitate the manufacture of the
gas on a large scale, and for its more perfect purification.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
The first public display of its illuminating
power was made at the rejoicings for the peace of
Amiens, in 1802, on which occasion part of the work-shops
of Messrs. Boulton and Watt, at Soho, was
brilliantly illuminated with coal gas by Mr. Murdoch.
In 1805, Messrs. Phillips and Lee, of Manchester,
had their extensive cotton mill fitted up with gas
apparatus, under the superintendence of Mr. Murdoch,
and the quantity of light given out by the
burners in all parts of the cotton mill was equal
to that of 3,000 <span class="locked">candles.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></span></p>

<p>Notwithstanding these eminently successful trials
of gas lighting, the prejudice against innovation
prevented, for several years, the extensive adoption
of the plan. As every establishment using gas had
to make it, and as the apparatus was costly and imperfectly
managed, the expense in the first instance,
the trouble, and the noxious smell, presented great
obstacles to the introduction of that mode of illumination.
The popular notion, also, that streams of flame
were rushing along the pipes produced an impression
that gas lighting must be very dangerous, which
it required time to disprove. It was not, therefore,
till several years after the advantages and economy
of gas had been practically established, that a public
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>company was formed for laying down pipes to light
the streets, and to convey the gas into houses for
lighting shops.</p>

<p>The person to whom the world is chiefly indebted
for the practical application of gas lighting is Mr.
Winsor, who had been a merchant in London. Being
very sanguine as to the advantages to be derived from
gas lighting, and possessing an ardent temperament
which no opposition could quench, he undertook to
introduce it to public notice, and to form a company
for lighting the whole of England with gas. He hired
the old Lyceum Theatre, which he lighted with coal
gas, and he there delivered lectures and exhibited experiments
to show the benefits that would arise from
the universal use of gas light, and coke fuel. He published
an extravagant prospectus of a company to be
formed, with the following title:&mdash;"A National Light
and Heat Company, for providing our streets and
houses with light and heat, on similar principles as
they are now (1816) supplied with water. Demonstrated
by the patentee at No. 97, Pall Mall, where
it is proved, by positive experiments and decisive calculation,
that the destruction of smoke would open
unto the empire of Great Britain new and unparalleled
sources of inexhaustible wealth at this most portentous
crisis of Europe. The serious perusal of this
publication, and an attentive observation of the decisive
experiments, will carry conviction to every
mind."</p>

<p>In this prospectus Mr. Winsor attempted to make
it appear that by adopting his plan there would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
"a grand balance of profit for the whole realm of
£115,000,000," and each shareholder of the company
was promised, "at the lowest calculation, £570 for
every £5 deposit." He entertained the notion of
making the use of gas and coke compulsory, by levying
a tax on all who obstinately refused to adopt what
would be so much to their own advantage. This tax,
he said, "cannot be oppressive in the least, because
it falls on the obstinate only, who shall resist the use
of a far superior, cheaper, and safer fuel." Not content
with the language of prose, Mr. Winsor vented
his thoughts and feelings in numerous poetical effusions.
The flights of his Muse, however, were not
into the regions of sublimity, as may be perceived by
the following <span class="locked">specimen:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Must Britons be condemned for ever to wallow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In filthy soot, noxious smoke, train oil, and tallow,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For with sparky soot, snuffs and vapours, men have constant strife,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those who are not burned to death are smothered during life."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Winsor's absurd statements&mdash;in the truth of
which he potently believed&mdash;and the wild, random
manner of making them known, excited much ridicule
and opposition. Among his opponents was Mr.
Nicholson, the editor of the <i>Chemical Review</i>, who
not only challenged Mr. Winsor's estimates, but the
validity of his patent, on the ground that Mr. Murdoch
was the original inventor. Mr. Winsor's plans
and calculations were burlesqued in a cleverly written
"Heroic Poem," published in a quarto volume,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
which, whilst professing to extol the virtues of gas
and coke, quizzed its hero most unmercifully. The
poem concluded with this <span class="locked">address:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">

<span class="i0">And thine outlive another Winsor's fame."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>"Though we may smile at Mr. Winsor's extravagant
plans and calculations," observes the <i>Journal of
Gas Lighting</i>, "we cannot but admire the enthusiasm
with which he pursued his object, and ultimately succeeded
in establishing the first gas company. The
lighting of Pall Mall with gas, in the spring of 1807,
gave increased stimulus to the project, and application
was made to Parliament to carry it into effect.
The bill was opposed by Mr. Murdoch and thrown
out; but in the following year (1810) the application
was successfully renewed. The scheme, however, as
sanctioned by Parliament, was sadly shorn of its magnificent
proportions; and, instead of a 'Grand National

were any special taxes imposed on those who should
obstinately refuse to use the light and burn the coke.
The Chartered Gas Company, established by Mr.
Winsor's persevering efforts, has served as the guiding
star to all other gas companies in the world."</p>

<p>The illuminating property of coal gas depends on
the quantity of carbon it contains. Pure hydrogen
gas burns with a pale blue flame that gives scarcely
any light, though it possesses intense heating power.
If, however, minute particles of a solid body&mdash;powdered
charcoal, for instance&mdash;be thrown into the flame,
they become white-hot, and the incandescence of those
solid particles produces a brilliant light. The same
effect is caused by the combustion of the carburretted
hydrogen gas, and in a more perfect manner. That
gas contains a large portion of carbon in a state of
vapour, and when a light is applied to a jet of the
gas the hydrogen immediately inflames, the carbon
is deposited in the flame, and the minute particles
into which it is disseminated become highly heated
and ignite.</p>

<p>There are two distinct states of carbonization in
illuminating gas. The commoner kind&mdash;the ordinary
coal gas&mdash;consists of two measures of hydrogen mixed
with one measure of carbon vapour. The specific
gravity of such gas is about one-half that of atmospheric
air, and it is eight times heavier than pure
<span class="locked">hydrogen.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></span> The best kind of gas for illumination is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
obtained from the distillation of oil. It is called olefiant
gas, and contains equal measures of hydrogen
gas and carbon vapour; its specific gravity is 0.985,
being about fifteen times heavier than pure hydrogen.</p>

<p>The <i>rationale</i> of the process of making coal gas
consists in expelling the volatile matters from the
coal by heat, in closed vessels or retorts, and then
separating the gas and purifying it on its passage
from the retort to the gas-holder, where it is stored
for use.</p>

<p>The retorts are usually made of cast iron, and are
about 7 feet long, 14 inches in depth, and the same
in width; the shape being that of an arch. The retorts
will hold two hundredweight of coal each, but
they are never filled, because during the process of
distillation the carbonaceous part of the coal expands,
and occupies more space than the original quantity,
the proportion of expansion being as one and a quarter
to one. There is a large aperture for the admission
of coal and the extraction of coke, which aperture
is covered with a lid, and screwed to make it
air-tight. A tube is inserted into the mouth of the
retort, to carry off the products of the distillation.
That tube rises about twelve feet, and then dips into
a large horizontal pipe, one foot in diameter, called
the hydraulic main, in which are collected the tar
and ammoniacal liquor that distil from the coal. Ten
or fourteen retorts are usually set back to back in
brickwork, to be heated by one fire; but the plan
has been recently introduced of employing long clay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
retorts, which are charged at both ends. These are
found to possess considerable advantage over iron,
not only from their lower price, but from the facility
with which the carbonaceous deposit is removed,
and the full charges worked off. Coke is generally
burned in the furnaces, and the heat is continually
maintained so as to keep the retorts red-hot.</p>

<p>As atmospheric air cannot gain access to the coal
in the retorts, the gases expelled do not inflame, nor
can the parts that are not volatile be consumed without
a supply of air. It is entirely a process of distillation,
in which all the products can be collected.
The volatile parts are carried off by the pipe, and the
solid carbonaceous matter, or coke, is left in the retort.</p>

<p>The first effect of heat on coal, after it is put into
the retort, is to expel the moisture, which, in combination
with the air, issues in the form of steam. Tar
then distils, with some portions of gas, consisting of
hydrogen and ammonia. When the retort has attained
a bright cherry-red heat, the disengagement
of the carburretted hydrogen is most active; and it is
found that the more quickly the coal is heated, the
greater is the quantity of illuminating gas generated.</p>

<p>The production of coal gas, and the development
of its properties at different stages of distillation, may
be readily shown by means of a common tobacco
pipe. Fill the bowl of the pipe with small pieces of
coal, cover it over with a lump of clay, and then put
it into a hot fire, with the stalk of the pipe projecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
through the bars. Presently steam will be seen to
issue from the pipe, and afterwards smoke, and, if a
light be applied, a jet of flame will issue forth, the
brilliancy of which will increase as the bowl of the
pipe becomes more heated, until the best part of the
gas has been distilled from the coal.</p>

<p>The gas is mingled with various volatile products
as it issues from the retort, and requires to be purified
before it is fitted for illumination. The most abundant
matter that passes over with it is tar. The vapour of
that substance, however, condenses when cooled, and
it may thus be separated from the gas very effectually.
For that purpose the gas, after having deposited a
large portion of the tar in the hydraulic main, is made
to traverse through a number of vertical pipes, and in
passing through them a further quantity of tar, accompanied
by ammoniacal liquor, is deposited, and collected
in a reservoir at the bottom. The next process
is the purification of the gas from carbonic acid and
sulphuretted hydrogen. This is commonly done by
passing it through water and lime; the combination
of the carbonic acid with the lime being facilitated by
agitation. The method of purifying by lime was introduced
by Mr. Clegg; and by a later process, oxide
of iron is used to absorb the sulphuretted hydrogen.
The gas, when purified, is conveyed to the gas-holder,
whence it is forced by pressure into the mains and
pipes.</p>

<p>An apparatus for generating coal gas on a small
scale for private establishments, remote from sources
of ordinary supply, is represented in the accompanying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
woodcut. The retort, A, is fitted in a small furnace.
The coal is put in at F, and the products of
distillation pass through the bent pipe, E. The more
liquid portions of the tar pass at once through the
tube, B, into the receiver, G; and as the gas passes
along the bent tube, C, it becomes cooled, and a further
deposit of tar and ammoniacal liquor is made.
The gas is then conveyed along another tube into the
purifier, H, filled with lime and water, and it thence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
passes into the gas-holder. Tubes are inserted into
the latter for conveying the gas to the burners.</p>

<div id="ip_201" class="figcenter" style="width: 407px;"><img src="images/i_b_200.jpg" width="407" height="421" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>The quantity and the quality of the gas yielded by
coal differ materially according to the kind employed.
One ton of good Newcastle coal will yield 9,500 cubic
feet of gas, which, when burnt in the best manner,
gives a light equal to that of 422 lbs. of spermaceti
candles. One ton of Wigan cannel coal yields 10,000
cubic feet, and gives a light equal to 747 lbs. of spermaceti
<span class="locked">candles.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></span> The price, in London, of good gas
from Newcastle coal, is 4s. 6d. per thousand cubic
feet, which gives a light equal to 74½ lbs. of spermaceti,
and equal to 89 lbs. of mould candles; therefore,
when the latter are 8d. a pound, the burning of gas is
twelve times more economical than the burning of
candles. In Liverpool, gas from cannel coal is supplied
at the low price of 3s. 9d. per thousand feet;
and that gas gives at least one-third more light than
the ordinary London gas.</p>

<p>The cleanliness of gas, as compared with candles
or oil, is a further recommendation; and for the purpose
of lighting streets, shops, factories, public buildings,
and halls, it presents important advantages; but
it is not well adapted for small sitting rooms, because
the heat of the flame makes it unpleasant and injurious
to the eyes when near, and, unless very pure, it
deteriorates the air of closed apartments. In many
parts of the country, however, where coals are cheap,
and the price of gas is consequently less than in London,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
it is introduced into every room of nearly all
private houses.</p>

<p>The best kind of gas made from mineral substances
is produced by the distillation of a bituminous shale,
called Boghead coal, which was discovered a few
years since in Scotland. One ton of this material
yields 15,000 cubic feet of gas, which is equal in illuminating
power to 1,930 lbs. of sperm candles. Boghead
coal is now commonly used for mixing its gas
with that of inferior quality, to bring up the illuminating
power to the required standard.</p>

<p>Olefiant gas, made from oil, burns with a brighter
and purer light than common coal gas, but it is more
costly. It is made nearly in the same manner, by
distillation in retorts; the principal difference consisting
in the degree and regulation of the temperature.
A dull red heat is the best, and in order to
keep the oil exposed to the action of an invariable
heat, it is admitted gradually into the retorts, into
which pieces of brick or coke are inserted to increase
the heating surface. One pound of common oil yields
about 15 feet of olefiant gas. The same kind of gas
may also be obtained in smaller quantities by the
distillation of tar, rosin, or pitch. Twelve cubic feet
of gas may be obtained from one pound of tar, and
ten from the same weight of rosin.</p>

<p>The brilliancy of gas-light depends, in some measure,
on the kind of burner employed. To obtain a
steady light, an argand burner is usually adopted;
the gas being allowed to escape through a number of
minute holes pierced in a hollow ring of metal, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
admits a current of air through the middle. To increase
the supply of air, the burner is covered with a
glass chimney, which, if not too long, adds to the
brilliancy of the flame; but a very long chimney produces
so strong a current of air, as to cool the flame,
and diminish the light. A plan is sometimes adopted
of placing a small metal disc a short distance above
the jets, so as to spread the flame. By this means the
brightness is increased, by exposing the flame more
directly to the current of air; and the metal disc, by
becoming heated, also tends to aid the combustion of
the carbon.</p>

<p>One of the problems to be solved on the original
formation of gas works was the size of pipes, and
the amount of pressure required to force the gas to
the various burners. It was at first supposed that
the friction against the pipes would oppose so much
resistance to the passage of the gas, that it could not
be transmitted to great distances. It was found,
however, that the perpendicular pressure of a few
inches of water was quite sufficient to force the gas
through the mains and small pipes of an extensive
range of streets. A bold attempt was made at Birmingham,
in 1826, to bring gas from the collieries,
at a distance of ten miles from the town. The plan
was laughed at by many as impracticable, but it was
attended with complete success. The gas being
made near the mouth of the coal-pit, the cost of conveyance
was saved by the additional outlay in the
first instance. It must be observed, however, that
it is extremely difficult in practice to avoid the escape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
of gas at the junctions of the pipes; and by
increasing the length of the gas mains, the greater
will be the leakage. The loss from this cause, in
some gas works, exceeds 20 per cent. of the gas
manufactured.</p>

<p>The volume of gas discharged from a pipe is directly
proportional to the square of its diameter, and
inversely as the square of its length. Thus, if a pipe
required to discharge 250 cubic feet of gas in an
hour, at a distance of 200 feet, must have an internal
diameter of 1 inch; to discharge 2,000 feet in an
hour, at a distance of 1,000 feet, would require a
diameter of 4·47 inches. The same quantity discharged
at double the distance would require a pipe
5·32 inches in diameter; at a distance of 4,000 feet
the diameter must be increased to 6·13 inches; and
at a distance of 6,000 feet the diameter should be 7
inches.</p>

<p>On the first introduction of gas-light, the companies
who supplied it charged a fixed sum for each
burner of a given size. This mode of charging was,
however, very unsatisfactory, for the size of the
burner is a very uncertain indication of the quantity
of gas consumed. Persons using gas desired to pay
for the quantity they actually burned; and to enable
them to do this, a special contrivance was invented
by Mr. Clegg, the engineer of the Chartered Gas
Company, called a gas-meter. That instrument
measures, with sufficient accuracy for practical purposes,
the volume of gas that passes through it to the
burners, and thus each consumer of gas now pays only
for the number of cubic feet consumed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
The accompanying diagrams represent sections of
a gas meter, as seen in front and edgewise. The outer
case of the instrument, which is a flat cylinder made
of sheet iron, is indicated by the letters <i>c</i>, <i>c</i>. Inside
it there revolves another cylinder, made also of thin
sheet iron, and divided into four compartments,
marked <i>d</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>d</i>. This interior cylinder readily revolves
on an axis, <i>g</i>, <i>g</i>, shown in the section of the
instrument as seen edgewise. The gas enters from
the street pipe through the opening, <i>a</i>, and it is
forced out to the burners through the pipe, <i>b</i>, the
latter being seen in the narrow section only. In that
diagram, also, there is shown a cog-wheel, <i>h</i>, fixed on
to the axis, and a small outer case, in which that
wheel rotates. Water is poured into that external
case until the gas-meter is rather more than half
filled, the level of the water being shown at <i>i</i>.</p>

<div id="ip_205" class="figcenter" style="width: 381px;"><img src="images/i_b_205.jpg" width="381" height="242" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>The action of the instrument will be readily understood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
by examining the two sections. The gas, on
entering the tube, <i>a</i>, presses against the upper surface
of the compartment that happens to be then
above it, and tends to turn the inner cylinder round.
This pressure forces the gas through the opening, <i>b</i>,
to the burner; and as the compartment then in communication
with that opening is emptied of the gas
it contains, in the direction of the arrow, it is
gradually forced under the level of the water, and
the other compartment, which has in the meantime
been filling with gas, continues the supply. Thus,
supposing each division of the inner revolving cylinder
to hold 108 cubic inches, a complete revolution
would indicate that the fourth part of a cubic foot
had passed through the pipe, <i>b</i>, to the burners.
Several cog-wheels, arranged like clock-work
mechanism, are connected with the wheel, <i>g</i>, and
by this means the number of cubic feet of gas consumed
is indicated by hands fixed to the wheels,
and pointing to the corresponding figures on a series
of dials.</p>

<p>Some inconvenience and irregularity having been
experienced in the use of the wet meter, the correctness
of which, it is evident, may be affected by variations
in the height of the water level, dry meters
have been constructed for measuring gas, by causing
it to pass through a small expanding chamber, similar
in principle to a pair of bellows. The objection to
these instruments is that the leather, or other flexible
substance that forms the sides of the expanding
chambers, becomes rigid by use, and the valves are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
liable to get out of order; but in the last improvement
of the instrument, by Mr. Croll, these objections
are stated to be effectually removed.</p>

<p>Numerous attempts have been made to produce
illuminating gas from other substances than coal, but
without advantage. The plan that promised the
most success was the production of hydrogen gas by
the decomposition of water, which was passed over
heated coke in retorts, and by that means the oxygen
of the water, combined with the incandescent coke
and the hydrogen, was set free. The gas thus collected
possessed little illuminating power, but it was
afterwards mixed with the rich gas from cannel coal,
and raised to the requisite illuminating standard. It
was found, however, in practice, that the compound
gas thus formed was more costly than ordinary coal
gas, and the plan has been discontinued. Another
method of giving illuminating power to water gas
was to surround the flame with platinum gauze,
which was rendered incandescent by the heat, and
became highly luminous. But it required twice
the quantity of gas burned in this manner to produce
a light equal to that of carburretted hydrogen, and
the combustion of so much hydrogen gas produced an
amount of vapour and heat that were very unpleasant.
That mode of gas illumination, called the "Gillard
light," from the name of the inventor, was also found
more costly than the ordinary mode of lighting with
coal gas, which has now no rival to compete with it
in economical illumination.</p>

<p>No Act of Parliament is now required, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
originally proposed by Mr. Winsor, to enforce the
burning of coal gas. Its advantages, in point of
economy, cleanliness, and even of safety, are sufficiently
understood to spread the use of coal gas to
every part of the kingdom. In the metropolis alone
there are twelve gas companies, who receive for the
sale of gas an average of £100,000 per annum each,
thus making the sum paid for gas lighting in London
£1,200,000, and it has been estimated as high as
£2,000,000. Taking the average price to be 4s. 6d.
per thousand cubic feet, the quantity of gas consumed
amounts to 5,300,000,000 cubic feet; and if we add
to that quantity 20 per cent. for leakage through the
mains and pipes, the quantity of gas manufactured
in the metropolitian gas works is upwards of 6,000,000,000
cubic feet in a year. It may, perhaps, give
a clearer notion of this immense quantity to say, that
a gas-holder, capable of containing it, would require
to be one mile in diameter, and the height of St.
Paul's Cathedral. The light produced by burning
such a volume of gas would be equal to that of
150,000 tons of mould candles, which would cost
£13,000,000. The quantity of coals requisite for the
production of the gas manufactured annually in London
is upwards of 600,000 tons.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_ELECTRIC_LIGHT" id="THE_ELECTRIC_LIGHT">THE ELECTRIC LIGHT.</a></h2>

<p>The Electric Light is the brightest meteor that
has flashed across the horizon of promise during the
present century. When first exhibited as a means
of illumination, about twelve years ago, the splendour
of the rays emitted, and the delusive representations
of the small cost required to produce such a brilliant
light, led the public to believe that the career of gas-lighting
was drawing to a close, and that night would
be turned into day by this wonderful demonstration
of electrical power. The light produced by charcoal
points, subjected to the action of a powerful voltaic
battery, was, however, no novelty at that time; for
as far back as 1810, Sir Humphry Davy was accustomed
to exhibit that development of electrical force
at the Royal Institution, and it formed a standard
experiment in most chemical lectures. But it seems
not to have been thought applicable in those days
to the purposes of illumination; and when Mr. Staite
brought it into notice, and exhibited its effects on
the tops of some public buildings, it was considered
one of the most wonderful inventions of the age.</p>

<p>Mr. Staite's patent, taken out in 1847, though
commonly supposed to be for the Electric Light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
generally, was limited in its clauses to the construction
of a voltaic battery and apparatus, adapted for
maintaining constancy, and for giving steadiness to
the light. The merely temporary continuance of
the <i>voltaic arc</i>, as it was formerly called, seemed indeed
to preclude the possibility of its adoption as a
means of illumination; it was therefore a great point
gained to give stability and constancy to the light.
The difficulty of accomplishing this will be perceived
when it is known that the charcoal points, between
which the action takes place, are constantly undergoing
change, the particles of carbon being transferred
from one to the other. There is no actual
combustion of the charcoal, in the ordinary meaning
of the term; the action is principally confined to the
transfer of the charcoal connected with the positive
pole, to that connected with the negative pole of the
voltaic battery, a hollow being formed in one, and a
pyramidical accumulation of particles in the other.
This action was beautifully shown by Professor Faraday
at the Royal Institution last year, by projecting
the image of the charcoal points on to a screen, by
means of the Electric Light itself. The image, magnified
by the lenses of the electric lamp, could thus
be distinctly seen without being too brilliant to dazzle
the eyes. The particles of carbon, heated to whiteness,
were perceived to be in active motion, and the
piling up of the pyramid in one, and the hollow
produced in the other, were continually varying the
distances between them, and thus tending to cause
unsteadiness in the light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
Numerous contrivances have been adopted for the
purpose of keeping the points at exactly the same distance,
as the want of stability was supposed to be the
only obstacle to the adoption of the Electric Light.
These contrivances have so far succeeded, that a
tolerably steady light can be maintained for some
time, but under the most careful management the
points occasionally approach too near or are too far
apart to maintain an equable light.</p>

<p>Among other inventions to increase the steadiness
of the light is one that was patented in 1856, by Mr.
Way, in which mercury is substituted for charcoal,
but the steadiness of light to be thus acquired must
be attained with a great loss of illuminating power,
and the vapour arising from the combustion of the
mercury would be extremely injurious to health.</p>

<p>Mr. Hearder, of Plymouth, has produced more
brilliant effects with the Electric Light than any other
person. Some remarkable exhibitions of the power
of the light were made by him, in April, 1849, from
the top of the Devonport Column, and several scientific
gentlemen undertook to make observations at
different localities to a distance of five miles. At
Tremeton Castle, on the banks of the Tamar, a distance
of nearly 3½ miles; the light cast a strong
shadow, and writing could be distinctly read by it.
The space illuminated was at least three quarters of
a mile broad. To aid the effect, a reflector was employed,
and when the rays were directed to the
clouds, they had the appearance of a huge comet,
the reflector being the nucleus. The intensity of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
light was ascertained to be equal to that of 301,400
mould candles of six to the pound, whilst the light of
the Breakwater Lighthouse was equal to only 150
candles. At a distance of five miles the light was
sufficiently powerful to enable persons to read a
book.</p>

<p>The battery employed by Mr. Hearder in these
brilliant experiments consisted of 80 cells of a Maynooth
battery, 4 inches square, and the carbon cylinders
between which the light appeared were formed
of powdered coke, mixed with tar, and rammed into
a tube three quarters of an inch in diameter. When
these cylinders are about a quarter of an inch apart,
the Electric Light appears at the end of each for the
space of more than half an inch. The light, during
the experiments at Plymouth, was maintained for
three hours, and the materials employed amounted
to one pound and a-half of zinc, 114 fluid ounces of
sulphuric acid, the same quantity of nitric acid, and
six pounds of muriate of <span class="locked">ammonia.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></span></p>

<p>The most serious practical objection to the introduction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
of the Electric Light, as a means of general
illumination, is its expense. When the project was
first brought into notice, attempts were made to show
that the battery power required might be obtained at
little cost, and in this respect some deceptions were
practised not creditable to the parties engaged in
promoting the scheme. It has been proved by Mr.
Grove that the cost of ordinary batteries necessary
to maintain the light in full brilliancy would greatly
exceed the price of an equal light from gas.</p>

<p>A plan was patented for generating the required
voltaic power, free from cost, by applying the residual
sulphate of zinc as paint, and an Electric Power and
Light Company was formed to carry out the project.
But the plan failed, and the affairs of the company
have recently been "wound up."</p>

<p>Until some cheaper mode of generating electricity
than is at present known be invented, there is no hope
of the Electric Light becoming generally available,
but there are special circumstances in which it may
be applied with advantage. It is peculiarly applicable
for lighthouses, as its rays would penetrate
through a foggy atmosphere that would obscure the
light of ordinary flames, and in such cases the extra
cost should not operate as an obstacle to its use.</p>

<h2><a name="INSTANTANEOUS_LIGHTS" id="INSTANTANEOUS_LIGHTS">INSTANTANEOUS LIGHTS.</a></h2>

<p>Those who are not old enough to remember the
time when flint-and-steel were the implements employed
to obtain a light, can have no sufficient appreciation
of the great convenience of "Lucifer"
matches. In those "good old times," it was a regular
household care to provide a sufficiency of tinder, to
see that it was kept dry, and that there was a proper
flint "with fire in it." The striking of a light, when
the tinder-box was adequately supplied, was no mean
accomplishment; and the unskilful hand, operating
in the dark, would either get no sparks at all, or
send them in a wrong direction, and not unfrequently
strike the skin off the knuckles, in the vain endeavour
to set light to the tinder. Or if the tinder were
damp, the sparks would fall upon it without igniting,
and minutes would be spent in holding a pointed
brimstone match to the delusive spark, and blowing
at it without effect. Sometimes the incautious operator,
tired with his fruitless efforts, would sprinkle
gunpowder over the tinder, to make it take fire more
readily, and whilst puffing at a long-desired spark,
the gunpowder would explode in his face and nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
blind him. Such were some of the annoyances, attended
by loss of time, that were experienced in obtaining
the same result that is now produced instantaneously,
and much more effectively, by merely
rubbing the match against any rough surface.</p>

<p>Several attempts had, indeed, been made many
years ago to supplant the flint-and-steel and tinder-box,
and some of the plans adopted so closely approach
the matches now in use, that we wonder the
inventors did not succeed long since in contriving the
very facile means of striking a light that we now
enjoy. Phosphorus and brimstone matches were
first employed for the purpose. The phosphorus was
contained in a bottle placed within a tin case, which
also held the pointed brimstone matches and a piece
of cork. The match was dipped into the phosphorus
bottle, and then rubbed on the cork; and the friction
excited sufficient heat to inflame the small quantity
of phosphorus adhering to the match and, to set fire
to the sulphur. These phosphorus boxes answered
the purpose very well, but the apprehended danger
of using so inflammable a substance prevented their
coming into general use; and they were much more
costly than a tinder-box.</p>

<p>In the next advance, if it may be so called, in
the invention of instantaneous light-producers, phosphorus
was altogether discarded, and a mixture of
chlorate of potass, then called oxymuriate of potass,
and sugar was employed. Those substances, when
combined, inflame explosively in contact with sulphuric
acid. In applying them for the purpose of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
obtaining instantaneous light, they were mixed together
in an adhesive menstruum, into which the ends
of small rectangular matches were dipped. These
matches very nearly resembled the "Lucifers" of the
present day. To ignite them, a small bottle containing
sulphuric acid and asbestos was provided, and
they were arranged together in an ornamental taper-stand
for the chimney-piece. This apparatus was not
received with much favour, partly on account of injury
done by a careless use of the sulphuric acid,
partly because it failed to act when the acid had
absorbed moisture from the atmosphere, but principally
because of its cost.</p>

<p>To obviate the objection arising from the use of
sulphuric acid in open bottles, an ingenious contrivance
was adopted, by which each match contained
its own reservoir of acid sufficient for igniting the
inflammable compound. Small glass globules, containing
sulphuric acid, were introduced into the composition
of chlorate of potass and sugar, which, when
broken, set fire to the mixture and lighted the match.
These instantaneous lights, which were called <i>Prometheans</i>,
were more ingenious than useful, because the
trouble of manufacture rendered them expensive, and
the sulphuric acid was more likely to injure furniture
in that form than when a bottle with asbestos was
used. The Prometheans, however, possessed the
advantage of portability, and for occasional purposes
they were convenient. In some of the forms in
which the Prometheans were manufactured, the glass
globule of acid, surrounded by its inflammable compound,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
was attached to the end of a small stick of
sealing-wax, sufficiently large to seal a letter; but
this refinement in instantaneous lights was not much
patronized.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these ingenious attempts to produce
light by chemical action, the flint-and-steel retained
possession of the field until a match was made
that ignited by friction alone. The first kind of friction
match was invented in 1832. It consisted of a
thin splinter of dried wood, the top of which was dipped
in a mixture of one part of chlorate of potass,
two of sulphide of antimony, and one of gum. To
ignite the match it was necessary to draw it briskly
through sand-paper. These matches required some
address to light them, because much more friction
was required than is sufficient to light Lucifers.</p>

<p>The next improvement was the "Congreve"
match, in which recourse was had to the materials
previously used, separately, for obtaining instantaneous
lights. Congreve matches were composed of
an emulsion of phosphorus mixed with chlorate of
potass, into which the matches, previously tipped
with sulphur, were dipped. These matches were of
the same size and form as the Lucifers now in general
use, and they ignited readily by friction on sand-paper
or other rough surface. Their explosive noise
on inflammation, which gave them their name, was
the only apparent difference between Congreves and
Lucifers, and their introduction completely supplanted
the flint-and-steel.</p>

<p>The noiseless match, or Lucifer, has, in its turn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
driven the Congreve almost out of use, though for
practical purposes the latter was as effective, and it
was less dangerous. The Lucifer matches depend
altogether on phosphorus for their inflammability.
Their composition is an emulsion of phosphorus with
glue, nitre, and some colouring matters. The sulphur
matches, after having been tipped with that composition,
are exposed in a warm room until a sufficient
quantity of the phosphorus is evaporated by slow
combustion, to leave a film of glue on the surface to
protect the remainder from the action of the atmosphere.
The usual proportions for the compound are,
phosphorus four parts, nitre ten, glue six, red ochre
five, and smalt two. The principle on which the
action of Lucifer matches depends, is the strong affinity
of phosphorus for oxygen, of which the nitre with
which it is mixed contains an abundant supply; and
by drawing the match across sand-paper, sufficient
heat is excited by the friction to ignite the phosphorus,
and the nitre supplies the oxygen to maintain
rapid combustion.</p>

<p>The manufacture of Lucifer matches is conducted
on a very large scale in this country and on the Continent.
It requires several ship loads of wood to supply
the requirements of Lucifer-match makers; and
ingenious contrivances have been patented for cutting
it up into splints of the proper size. For that purpose,
after the wood has been reduced to the required
lengths by circular saws, it is cut up into splints by a
number of lancet points, separated from each other
as far apart as the thickness of a match, which pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
over the wood and divide it with great rapidity. The
splints are collected into bundles of one thousand,
and each end having been dipped into melted sulphur,
they are divided in the middle by a circular
saw.</p>

<p>The Reports of the Juries of the Great Exhibition
supply a variety of statistical details respecting the
manufacture of chemical matches, from which it
appears that the quantity made in Austria, in 1849,
amounted to 50,000 cwt.; and that in France, in 1850,
the phosphorus consumed in the manufacture of
matches, amounted yearly to 590 cwt.; and the consumption
has rapidly increased since that time. In
this country, it is calculated that eight tons of phosphorus
are yearly used in making matches, the number
of which is stated to be 40,000,000 a day. Large
quantities are also imported from Germany, where
they are manufactured so cheaply, that fifty boxes
each containing 100 matches, are sold for fourpence.</p>

<p>The latest improvement in chemical matches is
the "Vesta," which consists of small wax, or stearine
tapers, with an igniting composition at the end, consisting
of chlorate of potass and phosphorus. These
Instantaneous Lights are made without sulphur, consequently
the disagreeable smell of the common
Lucifer is avoided. The convenience of smokers has
also been consulted in the manufacture of Instantaneous
Lights. The fusees, now so frequently used
for lighting cigars, are composed of thin card-board
cut half through, steeped in nitre and with a small
quantity of phosphorus; and the tearing of the paper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
across produces sufficient heat to ignite the inflammable
card.</p>

<p>Thousands of persons, principally children, are
now employed in the manufacture of chemical
matches. The occupation, as at present conducted,
is very unhealthy, for the fumes of the phosphorus
produce a disease of a remarkable kind in the jaw-bone,
which often proves fatal. No cure has yet
been found for this peculiar disease, occasioned by
the phosphorus in the state in which it is commonly
used. A preparation of that substance has, however,
been made which may be used without injury, and
which possesses the advantage also of being less dangerously
inflammable; but as the red <i>amorphous
phosphorus</i>, as it is called, is rather more costly, the
manufacturers of Lucifer matches object to use it.</p>

<h2><a name="PAPER_MAKING_MACHINERY" id="PAPER_MAKING_MACHINERY">PAPER MAKING MACHINERY.</a></h2>

<p>Cheap literature and the large development of
newspapers are principally attributable to the improvements
in Paper Making, by the aid of machinery.</p>

<p>In the former modes of making paper, the workman
held in his hands a square frame covered with
wires, which he dipped into the prepared cotton or
linen pulp, which was kept in suspension by being
agitated in water, and taking up a quantity sufficient
to cover the frame, he moved the pulp about horizontally,
to spread it evenly over the surface of the
wires. Another workman transferred the layer of
pulp on to felt, and in this manner one sheet was laid
upon another, with felt between each. They were
next subjected to great pressure, for the purpose of
making the fibrous particles cohere sufficiently to
form sheets of paper. The felts were then removed,
and the sheets were piled upon one another and again
pressed, after which they were dried, sized, and
finished.</p>

<p>Paper Making, by that process, was a slow operation.
The thickness and evenness of the sheets depended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
altogether on the judgment and skill of the
workman, and their size was necessarily limited by
the dimensions of the frame. By the improved
methods, nearly all the work is done by machinery.
The soft fibrous pulp, which is to be converted into
paper, enters the machine at one end, and in the
course of two minutes it is delivered at the other end
of the machine in a continuous sheet, that may extend
for miles. By supplemental contrivances the
paper is cut into sheets, piled together, and presented
in a salable form.</p>

<p>The world is indebted to a Frenchman, named
Louis Robert, for the invention of the first machine
for making paper. He was a workman in M. Didot's
paper mill, at Essones, and for his contrivance of a
method for making continuous paper, he obtained
from the French Government, in 1799, the sum of
8,000 francs and a patent for the manufacture of the
machines. The political agitation in France at that
period prevented much progress from being made
with the invention, but after the Peace of Amiens,
in 1802, M. Didot, jun. came to this country, accompanied
by his brother-in-law, Mr. Gamble, for the
purpose of making arrangements to carry it into effect.
They induced Messrs. H. and S. Fourdrinier
to engage with them in bringing the machinery to
perfection, and patents obtained in this country by
Mr. Gamble were assigned to them in 1804.</p>

<p>The engineering establishment of Mr. Hall, at
Dartford, in Kent, was selected as best adapted for
the purpose of making the machinery and for carrying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
the plans into operation. Mr. Bryan Donkin,
who was engaged in the
manufactory, principally
assisted in bringing the
machinery to perfection.
The difficulties attending
the completion of all the
parts, to get them to work
effectually, and the obstruction
encountered in
introducing the machine-made
paper, rendered the
enterprise a ruinous speculation
to those who first
engaged in it. Messrs.
Fourdrinier having expended
£60,000 in perfecting
the machine.</p>

<div id="ip_223" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><img src="images/i_b_223.jpg" width="600" height="175" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>The apparatus, of which
a representation is given
in the annexed woodcut,
was very complicated, but
the essential parts may be
readily understood.</p>

<p>The rags from which
the paper is made undergo
a variety of processes before
they are properly reduced
into a state of pulp.
They are sorted, dusted,
boiled, and torn into pieces
by passing through cutting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
rollers; they are then bleached and again submitted
to the grinding action of rollers, which reduce
them into a state of fine pulp, resembling milk in
appearance. The pulp thus prepared is placed in a
large vat, where it is kept constantly agitated, to
prevent the more solid parts from being deposited.
From the vat the pulp is discharged into a cistern,
over the edge of which it flows in a continuous stream
upon an endless wire cloth, the meshes of which are
so fine that there are as many as 6,000 holes in a
square inch.</p>

<p>The wire gauze, on to which the pulp is poured,
is about 4 feet wide, and 25 feet long, and it is kept
constantly moving onwards, by rollers at each end,
over which it passes. The gauze is stretched out
perfectly level, and the pulp is prevented from flowing
over the edges by straps on each side, which limit
the width of the paper. As the endless wire cloth
moves along, an agitating motion is given to it, by
which means the pulp is spread evenly over the surface;
the water is also drained off through the interstices
of the gauze, and this part of the process is
expedited in the improved machines by producing a
partial vacuum underneath. Before the sheet of pulp
has arrived at the farther extremity of the wire cloth,
it passes between two cylinders, the under one of
which is of metal, covered with felt, and the upper
one of wood. A slight pressure given to the pulp in
passing between those cylinders imparts sufficient
tenacity to it to enable it to be transferred from the
wire gauze on to an endless web of felt, by means of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
a slice that clears the pulp from the wire gauze, and
deposits it on the felt. The latter is kept moving at
exactly the same speed as the wire gauze, otherwise
there would be either a rent or a fold on the sheet.
The paper, still in a very wet state, is carried between
cast iron rollers, and its fibres are forcibly pressed
together, which operation squeezes out the water,
and so far gives tenacity to the pulp that it may be
handled without tearing. The sheet then passes on
to other rollers, by which it is further compressed,
and its surface smoothened. The paper is, however,
still damp, and requires to be dried. This is done by
passing it over large metal cylinders, heated by
steam. The process of making the paper is then
completed, and the continuous sheet may be wound
upon a reel to any length; but it is now usual to cut
it up into sheets as soon as it leaves the drying
cylinders.</p>

<p>The wire cloth moves at the rate of from 25 to 40
feet per minute, and such a machine would consequently
make at least 10 yards of paper in that time,
which is equal to a mile in three hours. The width
of the paper is usually about 4½ feet, therefore each
machine will make 10,450 square yards of paper in
twelve hours; and there are upwards of three hundred
of such machines at work in this country. The
value of the paper thus produced is calculated to exceed
two millions sterling.</p>

<p>Numerous improvements have been made in Fourdrinier's
original machine, but the principle of its construction
remains essentially the same, and it is by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
this means that most of the paper now used for writing
or printing is manufactured. A paper-making
machine, on a different principle, has, however, been
invented by Mr. Dickinson, and has been carried by
him to great perfection. Instead of allowing the pulp
to fall on to a flat surface of wire gauze, a polished
hollow brass cylinder, perforated with holes and
covered with wire cloth, revolves in contact with the
prepared pulp, and a partial vacuum being produced
within the cylinder, the pulp adheres to the gauze,
and its fibres cohere sufficiently, before the cylinder
has completed a revolution, to be turned off on to
another cylinder covered with felt, on which it is subjected
to pressure by rollers, and is thence delivered
to the drying cylinders.</p>

<p>Mr. Dickinson afterwards obtained a patent, in
1855, for making a union paper, consisting of a thin
sheet of that made by his own machine, and a similar
sheet made by a Fourdrinier machine united together.
For this purpose the two sheets were brought together,
as they passed from the machines, whilst still
wet and in an unfinished state, and were pressed together
between rollers, by which means they were
completely incorporated. The object of this contrivance
was to combine, in a single sheet, the different
kinds of surface which paper made by those
two modes of manufacture present. It is also employed
economically for engravings, to give a fine
surface to a thick sheet of coarser material. The
threads in postage envelopes and in bankers' cheques,
are introduced by this process of plating two surfaces
together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
The greatly increased consumption of paper threatened
to exhaust the supply of the raw material, notwithstanding
the large import from abroad and the
enormous supply derived from the waste of the cotton
mills, which, when mixed with rags, produces good
paper. The quantity of old rags, old junk, and other
fibrous materials imported for the purpose of making
paper, in 1850, is stated in the Jury Reports of the
Great Exhibition to have amounted to 8,124 tons.
This large importation, added to the stock of rags
supplied by the country itself, was, however, inadequate
to meet the consumption, and search was anxiously
made for other fibrous substances that could be
converted into paper;&mdash;peat, cocoa-nut fibre, grass,
straw, and even wood have been used for the purpose.
Of those substances, straw has been most successfully
applied, and straw paper&mdash;excellent to write upon,
though not bright in colour&mdash;is now made at very
low prices. The straw is first cut up into short
lengths, of about half an inch, by a chaff-cutting machine,
and after undergoing various processes of trituration
and bleaching, it is reduced into a pulp, sufficiently
adhesive to make a strong paper.</p>

<p>The plan of drying the paper as it leaves the rollers
of the machine, was introduced by Mr. Crompton
in 1820, and that gentleman was also the first to
introduce a machine for cutting the paper into sheets
as soon as it is dried. The first invention of the kind
was patented by Mr. Crompton, in conjunction with
Mr. Miller and Professor Cowper, in 1828. The continuous
web of paper was made to pass directly from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
the drying apparatus to the cutting machine, by which
it was first slit into bands of the required width by
means of a series of sharp discs of steel, adjustable on
two parallel axes. The bands of paper then passed
on to shears, placed transversely, that cut it into sheets
of any required length, which were laid upon one another,
to be divided into quires.</p>

<p>Several other cutting machines have since been
invented, the simplest of which is the one patented
by Mr. Dickinson, which is represented in the
woodcut.</p>

<div id="ip_228" class="figcenter" style="width: 424px;"><img src="images/i_b_228.jpg" width="424" height="150" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>The paper may be taken directly from the drying
cylinders or from a reel, as shown in the diagram at
<i>a</i>. The sheet passes over a large drum and through
several guide rollers, till it is carried across the table
<i>a h</i>, where it is cut lengthwise by knives, as it passes
along. A series of chisel-edged cutters are placed at
regulated distances beneath the table; and whilst the
paper is stretched over it, several circular knives, <i>f f</i>,
fixed into a swing frame, <i>g g</i>, at corresponding distances
with the knives beneath, are swung across the sheet,
and cut it in the manner of a pair of shears. Other
kinds of cutting machines are contrived, by which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
sheets of writing paper, when collected in quires, are
squeezed tightly together, and their edges are smoothly
and evenly cut.</p>

<p>We must not conclude this notice of Paper Making
Machinery without alluding to the ingenious self-acting
mechanisms for making envelopes. In the
Great Exhibition of 1851 there were three different
machines exhibited in action, each one producing,
with great rapidity, those neat coverings for letters,
for which the penny postage system has created so
great a demand. The paper, cut into the desired form
by a separate machine, was piled up on one side of
the envelope folder. It was taken, sheet by sheet,
and stretched on a small table, on the middle of which
there was a trap door, held up by a spring to a level
with the rest of the table. A plunger, of the same
size as the envelope to be made, pressed the trap
down into a recess, and raised the four corners of the
paper, the edges of which were then gummed, and
small mechanical fingers folded them down. The completed
envelope was then thrown out into a basket,
or it slided out of the machine on to those before made.</p>

<p>Each of those machines, with a boy as an attendant,
will fold 2,700 envelopes in an hour, which is
nearly the same number that an experienced workman
can fold in a day with a folding stick. Notwithstanding
the supplanting of manual labour to so great an
extent by these ingenious mechanisms, the effect of
increased facility of manufacture has been to give increased
employment, and many more persons are
now engaged in making envelopes than were so employed
before the invention of the machines.</p>

<h2><a name="PRINTING_MACHINES" id="PRINTING_MACHINES">PRINTING MACHINES.</a></h2>

<p>The associated inventions of paper making and
printing have progressed hand in hand together; the
increased facility with which paper can be made by
machinery having been equalled, if not surpassed, by
the rapidity with which it can be printed.</p>

<p>The old wooden printing press, that was in general
use at the beginning of the present century, is now an
object of curiosity, and a few specimens of it are to be
seen, even in country printing offices.</p>

<p>The principal working part of the wooden press
consisted of a block of wood, having a perfectly flat
and smooth surface, half the size of an ordinary sheet
of printing paper, which was brought down upon the
types by means of a screw that was turned by a long
lever. The types, placed upon a flat stone embedded
in a movable table, were inked with large soft balls
covered with pelts. The damped paper was put into
a frame, at the back of which blankets were placed,
and was laid lightly on the inked types. The movable
table was then pushed under the block of wood, called
the "platten," the long lever was pulled with great
strength, and the platten being thus brought forcibly
upon the blankets and paper, one-half of the sheet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
was printed. The lever, on being released, sprang
back to its former position, and the table with the
types upon it was pushed farther under the platten,
which was again pulled down to print the other half
of the sheet. The table was then pulled back, and
the sheet of paper, printed on one side, was removed.
These operations occupied considerable time, and the
regular work of two men, with a wooden press, was
to print 250 sheets an hour on one side.</p>

<p>This original contrivance for printing was supplanted
by the Stanhope press, one of the most admirable
arrangements for the advantageous application
of the lever that is to be found in the whole range of
mechanical contrivances.</p>

<p>The improved printing press, invented by Lord
Stanhope, the first of which was completed in 1800,
is made altogether of iron. The platten is of the full
size of the sheet of paper to be printed, and the work
is done at a single pull. The requisite power is obtained
by a combination of levers, so adjusted that
the platten is brought down rapidly in the first instance,
before any pressure is required, and when it
comes to bear upon the types, the levers act with the
greatest possible mechanical advantage, so that the
handle moves through the space of a foot, whilst the
platten descends only the twentieth part of an inch.
By this means a large sheet of paper can be printed
off by a single pull, and with more impression and
greater sharpness than by two pulls with a wooden
press.</p>

<p>Great as was this improvement in the printing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
press, its action was still very slow, compared with
the rapidity of printing we are now accustomed to, it
being considered quick work, with a small Stanhope
press, to print 500 sheets an hour. The author remembers
to have seen the <i>Globe</i> newspaper printed
by an old wooden press in 1820; and, about the same
time, the London <i>Courier</i>, by a Stanhope press. In
order to supply the large demand for the latter paper,
it was then customary to print off three pages early
in the day, and to set up the types for the fourth
page, containing the latest news, three or four times,
and to print it at as many separate presses. The
pressmen could thus, by great exertion, perfect the
printing, when three presses were used, at the rate of
1,500 an hour. The <i>Times</i> newspaper, which greatly
exceeds the size of the <i>Courier</i>, is now printed by a
machine at the rate of 13,000 an hour.</p>

<p>The invention of printing machines was preceded
by the manufacture of inking rollers, to supersede the
pelt balls for distributing the ink over the types.
Earl Stanhope had endeavoured in vain to construct
inking rollers, for which purpose he tried skins and
pelts of various kinds, but the seam proved an obstacle
that he could not overcome. In 1808, a "new
elastic composition ball for printing," which consisted
principally of treacle and glue, to serve as a
substitute for pelts, was invented by Mr. Edward
Dyas, a man of great original genius, the parish clerk
of Madeley, in Shropshire. These balls were first introduced
into the extensive printing office of the late
Mr. Edward Houlston, of Wellington, where they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
were for some time exclusively used, and that printing-office
consequently became celebrated for the excellence
of its work. A similar composition was some
years afterwards cast in the form of rollers, upon a
hollow core of wood, by the late Mr. Harrild; and
these rollers have proved a far more cleanly and more
expeditious mode of inking the types than the balls.
These inking rollers supplied an essential want in the
working of Printing Machines.</p>

<p>The invention of Printing Machines underwent
many changes before it was brought to a practical
form. Such a machine was first projected in 1790,
by Mr. Nicholson, who proposed to place the types
and paper upon cylinders, and to distribute and apply
the ink also by cylinders. Another plan, more
closely approaching that of the printing machines
afterwards perfected by Mr. Napier and others, was
to place the types upon a table and the paper upon
an impressing cylinder, and to move the table backwards
and forwards under it. In 1813, Messrs. Donkin
and Bacon proposed placing the types upon a
prism, which was to revolve against an irregularly
shaped cylinder, on which the paper was to be placed.
Nothing, however, could be effectually done in producing
a proper working printing machine until the
invention of inking rollers.</p>

<p>In 1814, Messrs. Bauer and Kœnig succeeded in
constructing a machine, which was erected at the
<i>Times</i> office, that produced 1,800 impressions an
hour; and it continued in use till 1827. This rapidity
of action, compared with that of the most improved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
printing press, produced a revolution in the art of
printing; attention was then directed almost exclusively
to the further improvement of the machines,
and the platten press was neglected.</p>

<p>In the form of printing machines generally used,
the types are laid upon an iron table that is moved to
and fro by the turning of a wheel connected with
a steam engine. The paper is placed upon cylinders
covered with flannel, and the impression of the types
is produced by the cylinders being fixed so closely to
them that, as the table passes backwards and forwards,
there is great pressure. The types are inked by a
series of rollers, by which the ink is distributed and
evenly laid on the face of the types without any
manual labour.</p>

<p>The mechanical power gained by an arrangement
of this kind arises from the pressure being exerted on
a small surface at a time; consequently the power
required for producing the impression of the types
is not nearly so great as when the whole surface of the
types makes the impression at the same instant. The
force actually pressing on the types, from contact with
the cylinders, is very much less than that brought to
bear on them by the platten of the Stanhope press;
but as it acts on a smaller surface at a time, the
amount of pressure on each part, successively, greatly
exceeds that received by any similar portion when it
is impressed all at once. The difference of the action
of the platten and of the cylinder may be compared
to the different effects produced by a knife when
pressed with its edge and with its flat side against a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
yielding surface; the pressure on the flat surface may
not be sufficient to leave any impression, whilst a
much smaller pressure on the edge will produce an
indentation.</p>

<div id="ip_235" class="figcenter" style="width: 399px;"><img src="images/i_b_235.jpg" width="399" height="211" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>The accompanying woodcut is a representation
of one of Messrs. Applegath and Cowper's machines
for printing both sides of the paper at the same time.</p>

<p>It consists of a cast-iron frame, about 14 feet long
and 4 feet wide, on which the iron table, with the
types upon it, slides backward and forward under two
large cast-iron cylinders, covered with blankets,
whereon the paper is laid. The pages of type to be
printed on one side of the paper, and those pages that
are to be printed on the back, are wedged into iron
frames, called "chases," and these chases are fixed on
the table at such a distance from each other, that they
will pass under the two cylinders in the same relative
positions. The sheets of paper are held on to the
cylinders at their edges by means of tapes, and are so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
laid on by the workmen, that the type may be impressed
on them with an equal margin all round. At
each end of the machine is a supply of ink, which is
taken from long iron rollers, about three inches in
diameter, each of which turns in contact with a flat
iron bar, that only allows a small quantity of ink to
pass. A composition inking roller is made to vibrate
between the inking table, where on the ink is thinly
and evenly spread, and the iron feeding roller, and
thus delivers the requisite quantity of ink on to the
table. Several other composition rollers are placed
across the inking table, with their axes resting in
notched bearings, so that as the inking table moves
forward and backward, those rollers distribute the
ink evenly over it. There are four other rollers (none
of which are shown in the diagram), which take the
ink from the table; and as the types pass from under
the cylinders, after printing a sheet, and return to
them, they pass twice under the inking rollers. Each
sheet of paper is laid by a boy on a web of tapes, by
which it is carried round one paper cylinder, and then
over and under two wooden drums to the other paper
cylinder. The sheet of paper, in the course of its
progress, is turned over, so as to receive the second
impression on the other side; and as the tapes that
carry it along leave the second cylinder, they divide,
and the printed sheet falls into the hands of a boy.</p>

<p>In the printing machine which was shown at work
in the Great Exhibition, invented by Mr. Applegath
and made by Mr. Middleton, for printing the <i>Times</i>,
the arrangements differ materially from those of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
horizontal machines already described. The types,
instead of being placed on a table, and moved to and
fro under the impressing cylinders, are fixed to a
large vertical cylinder, upwards of 16 feet in diameter,
and there are eight impressing cylinders ranged vertically
round it, with their axes fixed. By this arrangement
there is no loss of time in withdrawing the
types from under the cylinder to be again inked, but
they move round from one fixed cylinder to another,
receiving their ink between each, and thus producing
eight impressions in succession during one complete
revolution. At the <i>Times</i> printing office there are
now three machines of that construction, two of which,
with eight cylinders, print ten thousand an hour, and
the other one, which has nine impressing cylinders,
thirteen thousand.</p>

<p>The operations for printing that newspaper exhibit
marvellous efforts of human ingenuity and skill,
brought to bear in producing with the requisite rapidity
a sufficient number of impressions to supply its
enormous circulation. After the types have been
composed and corrected, and ranged into columns
and screwed up into their chases by upwards of one
hundred hands, each page of type is attached to the
large vertical cylinder&mdash;a curved form having been
given to the type to adapt it to the circular surface.
Nine men, standing each one beside a heap of damped
paper, feed the largest machine by separating the
sheets singly from the heap, and present them successively
to the action of small rollers, that give each
sheet a forward impulse, which brings it within the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
grasp of a series of endless tapes. These tapes catch
hold of the sheets of paper, and carry them down to
the level of the types. They are then shot along horizontally
to the pressing rollers, covered with blankets,
round which they are carried and pressed against the
types; after which the endless tapes carry them
away, and deliver them printed to a man below, who
spreads them one over the other. A large reservoir
of ink at the top of the machine supplies the inking
tables, from which it is spread evenly over the inking
rollers, and, at each revolution of the type cylinder,
nine sheets are printed on one side. They are then
taken to a second machine to be printed on the back,
or, as it is called, "perfected." The accompanying
engraving shows the general arrangement of the machines.</p>

<p>Few mechanical contrivances present so striking
an illustration of the application of human ingenuity
to the production of important results, and to the saving
of labour, as these printing machines. To see the
sheets of paper travelling along the tapes&mdash;to see
them shoot downwards, carried sideways in one direction
and back again, and delivered with half a
million of words impressed upon them in less than
three seconds, seems like the work of magic. To
copy that number of words, thus printed in three
seconds, would occupy a rapid penman forty days,
working ten hours a day.</p>

<div id="ip_238" class="figcenter" style="width: 430px;"><img src="images/i_b_239.jpg" width="430" height="522" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>Great as are the printing powers of these machines
of Mr. Applegath's, they have been surpassed
more recently by one placed close beside them, invented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
by Mr. Hoe, of New York. In that machine
the type cylinder is placed horizontally, by which
means the paper is supplied directly to it without
altering its direction. As many as twenty thousand
impressions in an hour have been produced by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
American machine, but it is not yet sufficiently perfected
to be brought into regular use.</p>

<p>In another part of the <i>Times</i> establishment there
is an ingenious machine for wetting the paper, by
which contrivance much labour and time are saved.
The paper, heaped in a pile at one end of a table, is
presented in quires at a time to the action of a roller,
which drags it on to a moving endless blanket, that
is kept wet by a stream of water, and the upper surface
is wetted by a long brush, placed over the
blanket. The wetted paper is heaped upon a truck,
which gradually descends, to keep the upper sheets
on a level with the table, till the paper is piled up a
yard in thickness. The truck is then raised, by
hydraulic pressure, to the level of the floor, and is
wheeled away and another one is loaded. Between
nine and ten tons of paper are thus wetted daily;
and the sheets of the <i>Times</i> printed during a year, if
spread out and piled one upon another, would form a
column as high as Mont Blanc. The quantity of ink
daily consumed in the printing is upwards of two
hundredweight. The machine is worked by two
steam engines, each of 16-horse power; and the noise
of the numerous wheels and rapidly revolving cylinders
is almost deafening.</p>

<p>The great rapidity and the comparative cheapness
of printing by machines, together with the greater
facility of making paper by machinery, have been
the means of creating a demand for books which it
would be impossible to supply, unless those means
were at command. Thousands and hundreds of thousands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
of copies of publications, that spread knowledge
among the people of the highest interest to the welfare
of man, and replete with useful information of
every kind, are now sold at prices which would be
impossible, were it not for the improvements that
have been made in the manufacture of paper, and in
the means of printing.</p>

<p>Nor should we omit to notice, as one of the causes
that have contributed to the production of cheap
literature, the art of stereotyping, which has been
perfected during the present century. Earl Stanhope,
the inventor of the admirable press that bears his
name, was prominent in bringing that art to perfection.</p>

<p>Numerous attempts had been made in the last
century to produce casts from pages of type. So early,
indeed, as 1700, some almanacks and pamphlets
were printed in Paris from castings; and an edition
of Sallust was printed in Edinburgh in 1739, from
stereotype plates produced by Mr. Ged, a goldsmith.
The process, however, was not encouraged, and on
his death it was not further proceeded with. The
most important advance in the art was made by M.
Hoffman, of Alsace, who, in 1784, succeeded in obtaining
stereotype plates by casting them in moulds
of clay mixed with gelatine in which the pages of
type were impressed, with which he printed a work
in three volumes; but the castings were imperfect,
and the plan was soon afterwards abandoned. Among
the many plans tried to obtain perfect casts of the
types when set up, was one contrived by M. Carez, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
printer of Toul, who, in 1791, endeavoured to obtain
casts in lead from a page of type, by allowing it to
drop on the fused metal when it was in a state of setting.
The matrices thus obtained were in like manner
impressed on a fusible metal, which melted at a
lower temperature than the lead. Good casts were
often thus procured, but the uncertainty of the process,
arising from the frequent fusion of the lead
matrices, caused it to be discontinued. Other plans
were tried in France with more or less success, but
nothing was done practically until Lord Stanhope
directed his attention to the subject in 1800, and resorted
to the original method of obtaining matrices,
by impressing the pages of type in a cold plastic substance.
He employed plaster of Paris for his mould;
and when they were thoroughly dried, they were
plunged in fused type-metal; and in this manner a
perfect cast in metal of the original page of movable
type was produced. The process has been still further
perfected, and casts from movable types, and from
wood engravings, are now made with great facility,
and the impressions from them are quite equal to the
originals.</p>

<p>When it is intended to stereotype a work, the
movable types used in composing it are new, and
the "spaces" that separate the words from each
other are longer than is customary when the type is
to be printed from. These elongated spaces reach
nearly to the face of the letters, so that the plaster
may not sink between them. By this means the
mould is easily removed from the face of the page of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
type. The metal casting of each page is very thin, and
when required to be used, it is screwed on to blocks
of wood to the same height as ordinary types.</p>

<p>Several attempts have been made to apply other
substances than plaster of Paris and type-metal for
stereotyping. At the Great Exhibition there were
specimens of gutta percha stereotypes, that produced
excellent impressions, and there were also fine stereotype
castings of type in iron, from which a copy of
the Bible had been printed. Papier maché has been
found to be a material peculiarly applicable for the
purpose, and it is now superseding the use of plaster
of Paris for taking casts of the types.</p>

<p>By the application of the art of stereotyping, casts
in metal of valuable works can be kept ready at any
time, to be printed from when more copies are required;
and the expense is saved of keeping on hand
large stocks of printed paper, or of having a work recomposed
when a further edition is wanted.</p>

<p>The inventions of Printing Machines and stereotyping
were strongly opposed at first by pressmen and
compositors, as calculated to diminish the demand for
their labour. In "Johnson's Typographia," published
in 1824, the "new-fangled articles" are mentioned in
a spirit of great bitterness; and the writer thus poured
forth his lamentations at the prospective ruin of the
members of his profession:&mdash;"We are much surprised
at the apathy and supineness shown by the body of
master printers with respect to the subject under discussion;
they most assuredly had good and sufficient
grounds for an application to Parliament for a tax,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
that should bring the work so executed upon an
equality with that done by manual labour."&mdash;"We
feel satisfied that the above would not have met with
encouragement from a British public, had they been
aware of the evils attendant on it; they have not
only to pay a full price for the work, but also extra
poor's rates, in consequence of the men being thus
out of employ; likewise they are countenancing the
breaking up and destruction of all the energy and
talent of that art which was England's proudest boast,
and her shield against all the threats of her foreign
foes."</p>

<p>These predictions of ruin have been completely
falsified. It has been with the Printing Machines as
with most other improved machinery for the saving
of labour: on their first introduction some hands, no
doubt, were thrown out of employ, but the advantages
derived from the saving of labour very soon reacted
favourably in creating a greater demand for
labour than before. The number of cheap periodicals,
and the extensive issues of cheap literature in
every form, require a much larger number of workmen
to supply the demand, even with the aid of machinery,
than was needed in the best days of the
manual printing press; and at no time were so many
compositors and pressmen employed as at present.</p>

<p>In the Reports of the Juries of the Great Exhibition,
some interesting statistics are given, showing
the influence of the invention of Printing Machines
in extending the demand for books and periodicals.
"The machine," it is observed, "created a demand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
and called into existence books which, but for it,
would scarcely have been thought of. As the machine-work
from type and woodcuts was far better
than the ordinary printing of the day, booksellers
were induced to print extensive editions, because
they saw the machine could accomplish all they required.
One of the first booksellers who availed
himself of this power was Mr. Charles Knight, who
projected the 'Penny Magazine,' on a hint from Mr.
M.&nbsp;D. Hill, Queen's Counsel. Each number, published
weekly, consisted of eight pages of letterpress,
illustrated with good wood engravings. The public
was astonished at the cheapness and good quality of
the work, but it was its immense sale which rendered
it profitable; for some years it amounted to 180,000
copies weekly. Mr. Knight, whose services in the
cause of educational literature entitle him to the
highest praise, expended £5,000 a year in woodcuts
for this work. The Cowper machine has been the
cause of the many pictorial illustrations which characterize
so large a portion of modern publications.
The 'Saturday Magazine,' 'Chambers' Journal,' the
'Magasin Pittoresque,' in France, and numerous
others, owe their existence to this printing machine.
The principle of <i>cheap editions and large sales</i> soon
extended to established works of a higher value. A
remarkable instance of this was the edition of Sir
Walter Scott's Works, with notes, edited by himself;
instead of the old price 10s. 6d., they were sold at 5s.
a <span class="locked">volume,<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></span> and the demand created by this reduction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
in price was so great, that, though the printer had a
strong prejudice against machines, he was compelled
to have them, the presses of his large establishment
proving totally unable to perform the work, which
amounted to upwards of 1,000 volumes per day for
about two years. The Universities of Cambridge and
Oxford have adopted Mr. Cowper's machines for printing
vast numbers of Bibles, prayer-books, &amp;c., &amp;c.
A Bible which formerly cost 3s. may now be had for
1s. Mr. Cowper recommended the Religious Tract
Society to put aside their coarse woodcuts, to have
superior wood engravings, and to print with his machine.
The Society adopted those suggestions, and
the result is, that by sending forth well-printed books,
it could now support itself by their sale, without any
aid from subscriptions."</p>

<p>As an illustration of the facilities afforded by the
invention of Printing Machines in producing cheap
editions of the writings of popular authors, the following
curious facts relating to the Works of Sir
Walter Scott, in addition to those furnished in the
Reports of the Juries, may be found interesting.</p>

<p>In 1842, a general issue of these Works, in weekly
sheets or numbers, at twopence each, was commenced
by the late Mr. Robert Cadell, of Edinburgh, and
completed in 1847. Of this edition, up to the present
period (1858), the astonishing number of <span class="smcap smaller">TWELVE
MILLIONS OF SHEETS</span> have been issued, the weight of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
which amounts to upwards of 335 tons! Another
edition was published simultaneously by Mr. Cadell
in monthly volumes at 4s., each containing about 360
pages; this series has reached a sale of more than
500,000 volumes. A third cheap issue, at eighteenpence
a novel, is now being published by the present
proprietors, Messrs. Adam and Charles Black, of
Edinburgh. Nearly 300,000 volumes have already
been printed of this edition.</p>

<p>It may be mentioned here, although hardly coming
within the scope of the present article, but as affording
a striking example of what literature has contributed
to the revenue of the country in the person
of a single author, that upwards of 3,500 tons' weight
of <span class="locked">paper<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></span> have been consumed in producing the
various editions of Sir Walter Scott's Writings and
Life; and the duty paid to Government on the paper,
even at the present reduced rate, amounts to no
less a sum than £51,450!</p>

<p>Since the Juries made their Reports, the development
of cheap literature has been greatly extended.
Newspapers, some of which contain eight full-sized
pages, of six columns each, printed in small type, are
sold for the marvellously low price of a penny, and
are stated to issue as many as 50,000 copies daily;
and some of the newspapers and other periodicals,
printed on good paper, are issued for a halfpenny.
Among the works of a standard character, published
at prices which nothing but a very extensive scale
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>could make remunerative, may be mentioned the
popular series which includes "The Reason Why,"
and "Enquire Within upon Everything." Of the
eight volumes already issued, each containing about
350 closely printed pages for half-a-crown, nearly
170,000 copies have been sold within a period of less
than three years.</p>

<h2><a name="LITHOGRAPHY" id="LITHOGRAPHY">LITHOGRAPHY.</a></h2>

<p>The art of printing from stone was invented at
the end of the last century by M. Aloys Senefelder,
of Munich; but it was not brought to such a state of
perfection as to be practically useful until many
years afterwards.</p>

<p>The principle on which Lithography depends is
the different chemical affinities of water for oily and
for earthy substances, which cause it to run off from
the one and adhere to the other. The drawing or
writing is made in oily ink upon a smooth calcareous
stone that will absorb water, so that, when the stone
is moistened, the water adheres to it and leaves the
lines of the drawing traced upon it dry. An inking
roller, charged with an oily ink, is then passed over
the stone and inks the drawing, but leaves all the
other parts of the stone quite clean. A damped paper
is next laid on, and when subjected to great pressure,
an exact copy of the drawing or writing is produced.</p>

<p>This simple and ingenious process has been carried
to such perfection, that the most beautiful artistic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
effects can be produced by it far more economically
than by any other style of engraving; and further
improvements in the art are being continually made.
It is satisfactory, therefore, to be able to trace its
history from its very beginnings, of which an interesting
account has been published by the inventor
himself.</p>

<p>M. Senefelder's father was an actor at Munich,
and in his youth he followed the same profession. He
turned his attention afterwards to music; and it was
in his attempts to devise some means of printing his
compositions economically that he chanced to discover
the art of Lithography.</p>

<p>He had previously made himself acquainted with
the methods of copper-plate printing, and he commenced
his operations by etching the notes of music
on copper-plates, covered with varnish in the ordinary
way. He found, however, that it would require
much practice to enable him to do this properly, and
not being able to buy copper-plates for his rude essays,
he thought of practising upon stones. Fortunately
for the success of his efforts, the quarries at Solenhofen,
near Munich, supplied him with slabs of stone admirably
adapted for the purpose; and it is a remarkable
coincidence, that the material which Senefelder used
for his experiments is the best for the purpose of Lithography
that has hitherto been discovered. His chief
object in making use of these slabs of stone was to
practise himself in the manipulation of writing the
notes, and of biting them in with <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">aqua-fortis</i> (nitric
acid), as he supposed the slabs would be too brittle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
to bear the action of the press. He did not try,
therefore, to have these etchings on stone proved by
the press, but he contented himself with holding them
up to a mirror to observe the progress he was making
in writing backwards.</p>

<p>Having at length been supplied with much thicker
slabs of stone, to bear the requisite pressure, he endeavoured
to grind and polish them sufficiently for
the purpose of being printed from, in the same manner
as copper-plates. He succeeded to some extent
in doing so, by means of diluted nitric acid; and he
contrived to obtain about fifty good impressions from
the stone.</p>

<p>In all these attempts at Lithography, the lines were
etched into the stone by the action of nitric acid, and
the only advantages professed to be gained by the
process were the questionable ones of comparative
cheapness of material, and greater facility of working.
M. Senefelder admits that there was nothing new in
engraving upon stone; all that he claims in that part
of the invention is, the manner of polishing the surface,
and the composition of the ink adapted for
printing from it. The most important step in the
progress of the invention of Lithography, as at present
practised, was made by accident, which he thus
<span class="locked">describes:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"I was preparing a slab of stone for engraving,
when my mother asked me to write a memorandum of
things she was about to send to be washed. The
washerwoman was waiting impatiently whilst we
searched in vain for a piece of paper, and the common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
writing ink was dried up. Having no other writing
materials, I wrote the washing bill on the stone I was
about to prepare for engraving, using for the purpose
my ink made of wax, soap, and lamp-black, intending
to copy it afterwards on paper. Whilst looking at
the letters I had written, the idea all at once occurred
to me how it would do to cover the stone, with the
writing upon it, with aqua-fortis, so as to leave them
in relief, and then to print from them in the same
manner as woodcuts, with a common letter press. The
attempts I had hitherto made to engrave upon stone
had taught me that the relief of the letters thus obtained
would not be much. Nevertheless, I made
the attempt. I mixed one part of aqua-fortis with
five parts of water, and poured it on the stone to the
height of two inches, having previously walled it
round with wax in the usual manner. The diluted
aqua-fortis was permitted to rest on the stone five
minutes. I then examined the effect, and I found
that the letters were raised above the stone about the
thickness of a card. Most of the lines were uninjured,
and retained their original size and thickness. This
gave me the assurance that writing, sufficiently traced,
especially if the letters were in printed characters,
would have still greater <span class="locked">relief."<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></span></p>

<p>Though M. Senefelder had advanced thus far, he
had not yet made application of the chemical properties
of ink and water, which constitute the distinguishing
characteristics of Lithography. That was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>reserved for a further discovery, also brought about
by accident. The difficulty he experienced in writing
words on the stone in the reverse way, induced him
to adopt the plan of writing the letters on paper with a
soft black-lead pencil, and then transferring them on
to the stone by pressure. He subsequently used lithographic
ink for the purpose; and in the course of his
experiments he observed, that when a paper written
on with lithographic ink, and well dried, was dipped
into water on which some oil was floating, the oil adhered
to the writing, and left the rest of the paper
clean, and that this effect was most striking when the
water contained some gum in solution. This discovery
induced him to try the effect on printed paper; and,
taking a printed page from an old book, he moistened
it with gum-water, and afterwards sponged the whole
surface with oil colour. The colour adhered to the
letters, and left the paper clean, and after further experiments
he succeeded in printing as many as fifty
copies from a page of printed paper; the letters, of
course, being reversed. The idea then suggested itself
of transferring, on to stone, letters written with
lithographic ink upon paper. The plan succeeded,
and the principle of the art of Lithography was thus
applied to practice. M. Senefelder, in his subsequent
improvements, gave a slight relief to the letters by
the original plan of using diluted aqua-fortis, by which
means the impressions obtained were blacker. He
also contrived the means of printing in colours from
stone, by reversing the process of ordinary lithographic
printing. To produce coloured prints, he left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
uncovered all the parts that were to receive the
colour, and the other parts of the stone were covered
with an oleaginous fluid, that quickly dried. On applying
any water-colour to the stone, it adhered to the
uncovered surface, and not to the covered parts, and
that colour was transferred to paper by pressure. In
this manner, by using several stones properly prepared,
the different colours required were printed, and
the effect of a coloured drawing was produced. Thus
we perceive, that almost at the first invention of the
art of Lithography, the ingenious inventor showed the
way of applying it to the production of coloured
prints, a process which has lately been carried to
great perfection.</p>

<p>Senefelder lived to see his invention extensively
adopted, and to reap benefit from his ingenuity. He
died at Munich, in 1834, after having been many
years the director of the Government lithographic
office; and, in the latter years of his life he received
a handsome pension from the King of Bavaria.</p>

<p>There is little to be added to the description of the
process of Lithography, beyond that given by the
original inventor in 1819, the principal advances that
have been made in the art having consisted in improved
methods of manipulating. The ink now generally
employed for drawing on the stone consists of
equal parts of tallow, wax, shell-lack, and soap, mixed
with about one-twentieth part of lamp-black; but the
composition is varied, according to the kind of design
to be executed. For writing or drawing upon paper,
to be transferred to the stone, more wax is added to
the ink, to give it greater tenacity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
The drawing upon paper, to be transferred to stone,
is not attended with any difficulty, and may be done
by ordinary artists. The ink is applied with a pen,
or camel's hair pencil, and when the effect of chalk
drawings is required to be imitated, the ink is shaded
by means of stumps, similar to those used in chalk
drawings on paper. Some artists prefer to work directly
on the stone with a camel's hair pencil, or
with a composition called lithographic chalk.</p>

<p>To transfer the drawing from paper on to the
stone, the paper is first sponged with diluted nitric
acid, which decomposes the size, and renders it bibulous.
After being placed for an instant between
blotting paper, to remove superfluous moisture, it is
laid with the drawing downwards on the stone, which
is slightly warmed. The stone is then passed through
the press, and the drawing adheres firmly to it. To
remove the paper, it is wetted at the back with water,
and, when quite soft, it is rubbed with the hand. In
this manner every particle of the fibrous pulp is
cleared away, and the drawing or writing in ink remains
as if it had been drawn directly on the stone.
To prepare the stone for taking the ink, gum water
is poured upon it, and it is rubbed over with a rag
containing printer's ink, which serves to blacken the
writing and prepares the lines for afterwards receiving
the ink.</p>

<p>The lithograph thus prepared is given to the printer,
who first etches it, in the manner originally practised
by M. Senefelder. The nitric acid employed
for the purpose is diluted with about thirty parts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
water, and it is poured over the stone whilst it is inclined
on one side. This process is repeated several
times, the object of it being not so much to give relief
to the lines, as to roughen the surface of the stone,
and thus facilitate its absorption of water. The nitric
acid also removes the alkali from the drawing ink.
In printing, gum is added to the water with which
the stone is moistened, as an additional preventive of
the ink adhering to those parts not drawn upon. The
printing ink is applied with large rollers, and the
damped paper having been placed carefully upon the
stone, with blankets at the back, it is passed through
the press.</p>

<p>The lithographic press somewhat resembles in form
an iron printing press, but differs from it greatly in
its mode of action. Instead of the large flat plate
that in a printing press is pulled down upon the
whole surface of the types, a long, narrow arm, called
a scraper, is brought to bear upon the stone, and the
table whereon the stone is laid is pushed forcibly under
it, by which means a great pressure is exerted on
a smaller surface at successive times, instead of being
brought to bear all at once. In the principle of its
action, indeed, a lithographic press is like a printing
machine, and steam lithographic presses have been
invented to work in a similar manner, though the
practical results have not generally been very successful.</p>

<p>Among the many applications of lithography, the
transfer of copper-plate engravings is one of the most
useful. An impression of the plate is taken on paper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
that is coated with a compound of flour, plaster of
Paris, and glue, and from the paper it is transferred
to stone. By this plan the original plate remains untouched,
and the printing from the stone is much

<h2><a name="AERATED_WATERS" id="AERATED_WATERS">AERATED WATERS.</a></h2>

<p>The invention of soda-water, in the state in which
it is now known, as an effervescing beverage impregnated
with three or four times its volume of carbonic
acid gas, is of very modern date. There are, indeed,
to be found in most of the old works on chemistry descriptions
of Nooth's apparatus for impregnating
liquids with carbonic acid; but all that was attempted
to be done by that apparatus was to produce an impregnation
of the water with little more than the
quantity of gas it will naturally absorb under the
pressure of the atmosphere. It was not until about
the year 1815 that mechanical pressure was applied
to force a larger quantity of gas into combination
with water, to imitate the briskly effervescing medicinal
waters of Germany.</p>

<p>Mr. Schweppe and Mr. Paul were the first who
introduced the manufacture of artificial effervescing
waters into England, and soda-water was then considered,
as tea was on its first introduction, entirely
medicinal. Indeed, the quantity of soda which was
at that time usually dissolved in the water gave it a
disagreeable taste; but when the manufacturers diminished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
the quantity of alkali, and increased the volume
of gas forced into the water, they produced a pleasant
beverage, which soon became in request for its refreshing,
wholesome qualities.</p>

<p>The apparatus for the manufacture of soda-water,
as it is usually made on a large scale, consists of a
strong vessel, furnished with a safety valve, in which
the water is impregnated with gas. This vessel, containing
about nine gallons, is made of thick wood,
well seasoned and nicely fitted, and bound round
with strong iron hoops, the heads of the cask being
well secured by means of iron bolts and screw nuts.
It is requisite that the receiver should be capable of
bearing a pressure of at least six atmospheres, which
is equal to 90 lbs. to the square inch.</p>

<p>The carbonic acid gas is generated from chalk or
whiting and diluted sulphuric acid. The materials
are mixed together in a small closed wooden or leaden
vessel, provided with an agitator, that can be worked
by a handle fixed to a projecting axis at the top. The
gas, as generated, enters by a bent tube into a gas-holder,
the opening of the tube being under water.
By this means the gas is freed from the fumes of sulphuric
acid vapour, and from the fine particles of
chalk that become mingled with it during its sudden
liberation. The gas sometimes undergoes a further
purification, by passing through a gas washer, before
it is forced into the water.</p>

<p>A small force-pump, worked by a crank, with the
assistance of a fly-wheel, draws the carbonic acid from
the gas-holder, and forces it into the water. The combination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
of the gas and water is facilitated by an agitator,
the axle of which projects through a stuffing
box, and it is worked either by hand, or is turned by
means of a small cog-wheel, that works into the teeth
of a larger one fixed to the crank axle, so as to produce
rapid rotation.</p>

<p>It is found requisite, in the first place, to expel the
atmospheric air in the receiver; for which purpose
the safety valve is left open for a short time after the
gas is being forced in, otherwise it would retard the
impregnation of the water by the gas. When the gas
and water are well incorporated, the liquid will contain
as many volumes of gas as there are atmospheres
of pressure in the air-space above it in a state ready
to effervesce, and one other volume, with water absorbs
under the pressure of the atmosphere. Thus,
when there are three atmospheres of gas under pressure,
each bottle of soda-water contains four bottles
full of gas, which are absorbed without perceptibly
increasing its bulk. The perfect impregnation of the
water with gas, however, requires time. The water
will, indeed, become brisk almost as soon as two or
three atmospheres of gas have been forced in, but it
will not acquire the flavour of good soda-water until
the gas and water have been allowed at least half an
hour to digest; and it is improved by remaining in
contact for several hours.</p>

<p>The temperature has considerable influence in the
process of impregnation, for in hot weather the gas
will not combine so readily, nor will the water absorb
an equal volume of gas. In summer time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
therefore, soda-water should be made before the
heat of the day, and ice should be added to the
water.</p>

<p>When the receiver is fully charged, and the operation
of bottling begins, every bottle-full that is drawn
off diminishes the pressure on the water that remains;
and if no means were taken to add more gas, the
soda-water would gradually become weaker and
weaker as each bottle was drawn off. It is usual, in
the best arranged apparatus, to have two tubes connected
with the force-pump, one of which feeds it with
water, the other with gas, by which contrivance water
and gas, in their proper proportions, are continually
forced into the receiver, which may thus be always
kept nearly full.</p>

<p>The process of bottling requires great manual dexterity.
The neck of the bottle is pressed by a lever
against a collar of leather fixed to a flange on the tap,
so that, when the soda-water rushes in, no air nor gas
can escape. The pressure inside the bottle therefore
quickly becomes equal to that of the receiver, and the
water ceases to flow through the tap, until some of
the air is allowed to escape. When the bottle is
nearly full, the operator quickly withdraws it with
one hand, and having a cork ready in the other, he
puts it in before the water can rush out. The cork
is then forced in further by pressure, and fastened
down by wires or strings.</p>

<p>A bottling apparatus has been invented for facilitating
the process; but a man accustomed to bottle by
hand can do it more quickly, and with as little waste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
of gas and water as with a machine. Much depends,
however, upon the state of the soda-water in the receiver;
for if the gas be well digested, and the temperature
low, it rushes into the bottle with much less
force, though the water may contain a greater quantity
of gas, than when it is newly made, and apparently
more brisk. The bottles very frequently
burst during the operation with great violence, and
unless they are enclosed in a guard, the men are liable
to be severely injured. Glass bottles have now generally
supplanted those made of earthenware, which
were formerly used; and though the glass bottles are
much stronger than the earthenware ones, the bursting
of them, when it does occur, is far more dangerous.</p>

<p>The process of forcing gas into the water by mechanical
pressure, in the manner described, requires
great labour, for the pump has to be worked against
a pressure exceeding fifty pounds on the square inch.
With a view to remove that inconvenience, and to
avoid the use of costly machinery, so that private individuals
might manufacture soda-water, the author
contrived a modification of Nooth's apparatus, for
which he obtained a patent in 1831. By that means,
the gas is generated in a closed vessel, and forces itself
into the water by its own elasticity. Any amount
of pressure can thus be obtained by chemical action
alone. The accompanying woodcut represents a section
of the apparatus in its improved form. The vessel,
A, is made of very strong stone ware, inside which
is the gas generator <i>b</i>. A few inches from the bottom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
of the generator is the partition, <i>a</i>, perforated with
holes, and near the top there is inserted the small
tube, <i>c</i>, which conveys the gas down to a perforated expansion
of the tube, <i>d</i>, through the apertures of which
the gas issues into the water contained in A. Another
tube, <i>e</i>, reaches near the bottom, and is connected
with a stop-cock for the purpose of drawing off the
aerated liquid. In charging the apparatus, the interior,
A, is nearly filled with water, or other liquid,
through the opening, <i>f</i>, which is then closed by cork,
which is kept in its place by a screw nut. A few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
ounces of carbonate of soda, mixed with water, are
then poured into the generator through the opening
at <i>g</i>. The mixture flows through the apertures in the
partition, and occupies the lower part of the generator.
A proportionate quantity (about three-fourths
of the weight of the soda) of tartaric acid in crystals
is then introduced through <i>g</i>, which lodge on the top
of the partition without touching the soda. The opening
being then closed by a screw-nut, the apparatus,
which is mounted on pivots, with an appropriate
stand, is swung backwards and forwards like a pendulum.
The effect of this agitation is to force a portion
of the water saturated with carbonate of soda
through the apertures at <i>a</i>, where it comes in contact
with the tartaric acid, and instantly generates carbonic
acid gas. The gas, having no other escape than
through the tube, <i>c</i>, is forced into the vessel A, and
becomes mingled with the water by the same act of
vibration that brings the soda and tartaric acid together.
The continuance of the vibratory action for
a short time generates sufficient gas to aerate the water
or other liquid contained in the vessel, A. When the
aeration is completed, the soda-water may be drawn
off, as required, through the stop-cock. The apparatus
is made of two sizes, to hold one and two gallons.</p>

<div id="ip_264" class="figcenter" style="width: 306px;"><img src="images/i_b_263.jpg" width="306" height="401" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>The tartaric acid and soda in the generator do not
mingle with the water, and the tartrate of soda,
resulting from the combination, is emptied after the
soda-water is drawn off, before renewing the charge.</p>

<p>A French modification of this apparatus, in glass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
vessels protected by cane netting, called a "gasogene,"
has recently been introduced, and is extensively used.
The materials for generating the carbonic acid gas
are put into the smaller vessels, and kept separate
until the apparatus is inverted, and then gas is rapidly
generated, and forces itself through the water.</p>

<p>The powders that are sold for making soda-water,
by mixing them together, consist of carbonate of soda
and tartaric acid. When brought together in solution,
a violent effervescence ensues, but the gas is not
combined with the water in the same manner as when
it is forced in and allowed to remain for some time
with the liquid to be aerated. There is the further
disadvantage attending such powders, that the tartrate
of soda, formed by the tartaric acid and the carbonate
of soda, employed to generate the gas, is
drunk with the water.</p>

<h2><a name="REVOLVERS_AND_MINIE_RIFLES" id="REVOLVERS_AND_MINIE_RIFLES">REVOLVERS AND MINIE RIFLES.</a></h2>

<p>"Is there anything whereof it may be said, See,
this is new? it hath been already of old time, which
was before <span class="locked">us."<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></span> This observation of Solomon, the
correctness of which we have often seen verified in
this History of Inventions, is applicable even to that
great apparent novelty the formidable "Revolver"&mdash;that
death-dealing weapon, which will fire six shots
in rapid succession by merely pulling the trigger so
many times, as fast as it is possible.</p>

<p>The Revolver was almost unknown in this country
until 1851, when it was brought prominently into
notice at the Great Exhibition, by the specimens
shown there by Colonel Colt, of the United States.
Pistols with six barrels, which might be fired successively
with the same lock, by turning them round,
were, indeed, previously seen in gun-shops; but their
clumsy form and their great weight prevented them
from being used. Nor was Colonel Colt much more
successful in his earlier attempts to bring his Revolver
into public notice. He obtained his first patent in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>America in 1835, and established a manufactory for
the pistols at Paterson, United States, where he expended
£35,000 in attempting to bring the fire-arm
to perfection, but with no beneficial result to himself
beyond gaining costly experience. He made further
improvements in 1849, and so far perfected the
weapon that it had been used extensively in America
before it was brought into notice in this country.</p>

<p>When Colonel Colt came to England, he undertook
to investigate the origin of repeating fire-arms,
with a view to ascertain how far he had been anticipated;
and the result of his researches was, that repeating
fire-arms, similar in principle to his own
Revolver, had been invented <i>four centuries before</i>.</p>

<p>He found in the Armoury of the Tower of London
a matchlock gun, supposed to have been made as
early as the fifteenth century, which very closely resembles,
in the principle of its construction, the Revolver
of the present day. It has a revolving breech
with four chambers, mounted on an axis fixed parallel
to the barrel, and on that axis it may be turned
round, to bring any one of the four loaded chambers
in succession in a line with the barrel, to be discharged
through it. There are notches in a flange at
the fore end of the revolving breech to receive the
end of a spring, which is fixed to the stock of the gun,
for the purpose of locking the breech when a chamber
is brought round into the proper position. The hammer
is split at the end, so as to clasp a match, and to
carry its ignited end down to the priming powder
when the trigger is pulled. Each chamber is provided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
with a priming pan that is covered by a swing
lid, and, before firing, the lid is pushed aside by the
finger, to expose the priming powder to the action of
the lighted match. If the date of this gun be correctly
stated, a very rapid advance in the art of gunnery
must have been made after the invention of gunpowder,
which took place only one hundred years
previously. The want of a better mode of discharging
the gun than a lighted match was one of the chief
obstacles to the introduction of the Revolver four centuries
ago.</p>

<p>There is also in the Tower Armoury a specimen
of a repeating fire-arm of a more recent date, though
still very ancient, that presents considerable improvement
on the preceding one. It has six chambers in
the rotating breech, and is furnished with a barytes
lock and one priming pan, to fire all the chambers.
The priming pan is fitted with a sliding cover, and a
vertical wheel with a serrated edge projects into it,
nearly in contact with the powder in the pan. To
this wheel a rapid motion is given by means of a
trigger-spring, acting upon a lever attached to the
axis of the wheel; and the teeth of the wheel strike
against the barytes, which is brought down, previously
to firing, into contact with it, and the sparks thus
emitted set fire to the powder in the priming pan,
and discharge the piece. In this instance, also, the
breech is rotated by hand.</p>

<p>A still further advance towards perfection in repeating
fire-arms is to be seen in the United Service
Museum, where there is a pistol, supposed to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
been made in the time of Charles I., with the breech
rotated by mechanical means. In this pistol, the act
of pulling back the hammer turns the breech, containing
six chambers, one-sixth part of a revolution,
and the priming powder is ignited by a flint hammer
striking against steel.</p>

<p>The manufacture of these fire-arms presented some
practical difficulties which could only be overcome
by great care and skill in the construction; and from
the failure in this respect they were not patronized.
It was necessary, in the first place, that the loaded
chambers should be brought into an exact line with
the barrel, and be firmly retained there during the
discharge. It also required great nicety in the fitting
of the breech to the barrel, to prevent the fire from
communicating to the other chambers. A further
difficulty was to prevent the spindle, whereon the
breech revolved, from becoming foul by the explosion
of the powder; otherwise, after firing a few times it
would stick fast, and the gun would become useless.</p>

<p>The earliest patent for repeating fire-arms in this
country was obtained by James Puckle, in 1718, for
a gun with a rotating breech. There were six chambers
in the breech, which was turned round by a
winch, and, when the six were fired, there was an arrangement
by which the chambered breech could be
removed, and another loaded one substituted for it.
Mr. Puckle appears to have been of a poetical turn
of mind, and the specification of his patent is enlivened
by the following loyal couplet, which deserves to be
quoted as a novelty in patent <span class="locked">records:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span></p>

<span class="i0">"Defending King George, our country and laws,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is defending yourselves and the Protestant cause."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The invention of percussion priming in 1800, by
the Rev. A.&nbsp;J. Forsyth, was an important step towards
the perfection of fire-arms generally, and of Revolvers
in particular; for until the chambered breech could
carry round with it in a compact form the priming
for each chamber, the construction must have been
clumsy, and the action uncertain.</p>

<p>Colonel Colt, as already stated, took out his first
patent in 1835, and in 1849 he patented the improved
Revolver, which he has brought into general use. It
has six chambers in the rotating breech, and the nipples
to hold the percussion caps are sunk into a recess,
so that the lateral fire, if any, cannot reach them; and
at the other end, the chambers are protected from
lateral fire by chamfering their mouths. By these
means, the danger of firing the gunpowder in the
other chambers is effectually provided against.</p>

<p>The demand for Colt's Revolvers became so great
after the last improvements were made, that at his
manufactory, at Hartford, in America, he made 53,000
of them in 1853; and at his manufactory at Vauxhall,
near London, he employs upwards of 300 workmen,
though by far the largest portion of the work is done
by machinery.</p>

<p>Several improvements have been introduced in
Revolvers since Mr. Colt's patent of 1849, among
which is the arrangement, made by Mr. Adams in
1851, for causing the chambered breech to turn by
the action of pulling the trigger, which at the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
time draws back the hammer. By this arrangement,
the whole of the six loaded chambers may be discharged
in three seconds, whilst the pistol continues
presented.</p>

<p>The latest improvements in Revolvers were contrived
by Mr. Josiah Ells, of Pittsburg, North America,
as specified in a patent obtained for him by the
author, in his own name, in 1855. The annexed
woodcuts show the figure of this Revolver, with the
working parts round the lock exposed to view, together
with the shape of the revolving chambered
breech.</p>

<div id="ip_271" class="figcenter" style="width: 407px;"><img src="images/i_b_271.jpg" width="407" height="315" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>In this improved Revolver, the force required to
pull back the hammer, <i>a</i>, is regulated by a double<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
spring, <i>w</i>, so as to diminish as the hammer is drawn
back; and at the moment of firing a slight pull of the
trigger is sufficient. Another improvement consists
in the addition to the chambered breech, <i>d</i>, of a projecting
tube, which prevents the spindle on which it
turns from becoming foul; and there is also a safety
bolt added, as a protection against accidental firing.</p>

<p>The plan of making the mere action of drawing
the trigger turn the chambered breech and pull back
the hammer, as originally contrived by Mr. Adams,
required so much force to pull the trigger as to interfere
materially with the accuracy of aim. There
was danger, also, in that mode of turning the chambered
breech, arising from premature firing. In Mr.
Ells's Revolver these objections are in a great
measure obviated; first, by the action of the double
spring, by which the force required is diminished as
the trigger is pulled farther back; and in the second
place, by making the shoulder of the hammer catch
into a small notch, which holds it at full cock, until,
by a further pull of the trigger, the pistol is fired.</p>

<p>An improvement in the art of war, no less important
than the Revolver, was introduced nearly at
the same time. The Revolver affords a formidable
means for attack or defence at short distances, whilst
the Minié Rifle extends the destructive range of fire-arms
far beyond the distance to which the ordinary
musket ball could reach. The principle of rifling gun
barrels was first made known in the specification of
an invention patented in 1789, by Mr. Wilkinson, the
improvement he effected being thus described:&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>"The
gun, or piece of ordnance, after being bored in
the usual method, hath cut therein two spiral grooves,
which run the whole length of the bore. These
curves, according to their curvature, will give a circular
motion to the shot during its flight."</p>

<p>The spiral grooves, when the bullets are rammed
down, cause the ball to offer greater resistance, therefore
the explosive force of the gunpowder is brought
to act upon them more completely before they leave
the gun barrel; and the rotary motion imparts greater
steadiness to the ball. Rifled barrels, therefore, carry
the balls farther, and increase the accuracy of the
aim. They, however, require increased power and
longer time to ram down the ball in loading, and the
risk of bursting the gun is increased if the ball be not
rammed close upon the powder. For these reasons,
they were considered unfit to be employed generally
by soldiers, and they were entrusted only to select
corps of rifle shooters. The object of Captain Minié's
invention was to facilitate the loading of rifles, by
contriving a bullet which might be easily rammed in,
and would expand in the act of firing, so as to fill up
the grooves. What is commonly called the Minié
Rifle is, in fact, only a Minié Rifle Ball, for the
barrels of the guns are nearly the same as the
ordinary grooved rifles.</p>

<p>The ball is an elongated one, with a hollow cone
at the bottom, into which is fixed an iron button.
When the gun is fired, the button is forced into the
cone, and expands the lead, which thus fills up the
grooves and gives a spiral direction to the bullet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
The Minié ball serves the purpose excellently for a
short time, but after firing several rounds the iron
button is forced through the lead, leaving a portion
of it behind, which clogs up the barrel, and renders it
unfit for use.</p>

<p>Several substitutes for iron were tried, to remove
that inconvenience, and it was at length found that
the button might be dispensed with altogether, for
the hollow cone is of itself sufficient to expand the
lead. The balls are, therefore, now made in that
manner at the Government gun manufactory at Enfield,
and the rifled guns now used in the army,
which carry bullets to the distance of a mile and
more, are called the <i>Enfield Rifle</i>. The cost of each
of these rifles to the Government is stated to be £3
4s. 7½d. As the balls are made to slip into the barrels
easily, they can be loaded as readily as the common
musket: and they will carry three times the
distance, with much more certainty.</p>

<h2><a name="CENTRIFUGAL_PUMPS" id="CENTRIFUGAL_PUMPS">CENTRIFUGAL PUMPS.</a></h2>

<p>Many ingenious men have vainly attempted to
apply what has been erroneously called "centrifugal
force" as a motive power, conceiving that the effort
made by bodies to fly off when whirled round in a
circle was occasioned by a force generated by their
rotation. The experiment of the "whirling table,"
which is commonly shown to illustrate centrifugal
action, tends to confirm the notion that force is generated;
for it is there seen that, when the velocity of
rotation is doubled, the centrifugal force is quadrupled,
and that it continues to increase in a geometrical
ratio. It has, therefore, been conceived that a
power might be generated of indefinite amount; for
as a double velocity can be communicated by doubling
the moving power, whilst the tendency to fly off
at the circumference is quadrupled, there appeared to
be a creation of power which, if properly applied,
would realize perpetual motion.</p>

<p>A working engineer known to the author was so
fully possessed with the notion that power might thus
be created, and that its application would be of the
utmost benefit, that he imagined he had been specially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
appointed to reveal the principle to man, as a boon
of inestimable value to the manufacturing arts. The
plan he adopted was to employ what he called a
generating engine, consisting of a centrifugal pump;
and the force with which the water was projected
from the ends of two rotating horizontal arms was
directed against pistons working in cylinders, as the
force of steam is in a steam engine. Having once
set this machine in action, he expected to be able, by
means of the self-creating centrifugal force, to generate
the power that worked the generating engine,
and thus to have a reservoir of force of any magnitude
constantly at command. So completely satisfied
was he of the practicability of the plan, founded, as
he supposed, upon one of Newton's laws of motion,
and he felt so happy in the thought of being charged
with an important mission for the benefit of mankind,
that it was almost cruel to attempt to correct his notions
of the power of centrifugal force. He spent all
his money in endeavouring to realize this impossible
project, and even its failure did not convince him of
his error.</p>

<p>The simple kind of Centrifugal Pump applied in
that chimerical scheme was known upwards of one
hundred years ago. It consisted of a vertical hollow
shaft, into which were inserted two horizontal arms.
The shaft was supported on a pivot at the bottom, and
was turned by a handle at the top, as represented in
the accompanying drawing. The lower end of the
vertical shaft was immersed in water, and when
rotary motion was given to the machine, the centrifugal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
action propelled the water from the ends of the
arms, and the water rose in the vertical shaft to supply
its place.</p>

<div id="ip_277" class="figcenter" style="width: 310px;"><img src="images/i_b_277.jpg" width="310" height="347" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>The effect in a pump of this construction is due
to the pressure of the atmosphere, for the outpouring
of the water from the rotating arms tends to produce
a vacuum in the shaft, in the same manner as the
lifting of the plunger in a common pump. It is
evident, therefore, that a Centrifugal Pump of that
construction could not raise a column of water higher
than the pressure of the atmosphere would force it
up, which would be about thirty feet.</p>

<div id="ip_277b" class="figcenter" style="width: 386px;"><img src="images/i_b_278.jpg" width="386" height="408" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>Mr. Appold's Centrifugal Pump, which constituted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
one of the most remarkable features of the
Machinery Department of the Great Exhibition, is
constructed on a different plan, though the principle
is the same. The rotating arms are immersed in the
water to be raised, and to diminish the resistance
which would be produced by the rotation in water of
two or more exposed arms, they are enclosed within
discs of metal, about one foot in diameter, and three
or four inches apart. The arms are formed by curved
partitions between the discs, which radiate from the
centre to the outer rim, towards which the space between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
the discs is contracted. This pump is fixed on
an axis, to which rapid rotary motion can be given;
and it is fitted into a case connected with the pipe
that conveys the water to the discharging orifice.
The water enters the rotating disc through a large
aperture in the centre, and it is forced through the
spaces formed by the radical arms with increasing
velocity, until it escapes from the circumference.
Sections of Mr. Appold's pump are shown in the accompanying
diagrams, in which A is the central
opening for the admission of water; C, C, C, the
curved radical partitions which form the arms by
which motion is communicated to the water, and
through the ends of which it issues into the external
case, connected with the lift-pipe, D.</p>

<p>In the Great Exhibition there were two other
Centrifugal Pumps shown in action, one by Mr. Bessemer,
and one by Mr. Gwynne, from America; but
neither of them exhibited such striking effects as Mr.
Appold's, which was so arranged as to throw out a
continuous cascade of water from an aperture six feet
wide, at a height of twenty-six feet. The Jury of
Class V., who made numerous experiments to determine
the practical efficiency of Centrifugal Pumps,
and the relative merits of the three exhibited, reported
very favourably of that of Mr. Appold, to whom a
Council Medal was awarded. When rotating at the
rate of 788 revolutions in a minute, and lifting the
water 19·4 feet, the greatest practical effect, compared
with the power employed, was attained. The discharge
of water per minute at that height, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
pump rotating with a velocity of 788 revolutions, was
1,236 gallons; and with a lift of 8 feet, 2,100 gallons
per minute were discharged, when the rotating
velocity was 828 revolutions per minute. In Mr.
Gwynne's and Mr. Bessemer's pumps, which had
straight vanes, the ratio of power to the effect did not
exceed 0·19. One of Mr. Appold's pumps, only one
inch in diameter (the exact size of the small diagram),
will discharge ten gallons per minute. The greatest
height to which water has been raised by the pumps
that are one foot in diameter is 67·7 feet, with a
velocity of 4,153 feet per minute.</p>

<p>The velocity with which the pump should revolve
depends upon the height to which the water is to be
raised. Beyond a certain height, the required velocity
is practically unattainable, but long before that
limit is reached the waste of power becomes so great,
that the pump is of no value, for the pressure on the
circumference counteracts the force with which the
water is expelled. It is, therefore, only at comparatively
low levels that the Centrifugal Pump is a useful
engine. The absence of all valves renders it very
suitable for draining marshes, and for other similar
purposes, as the muddy water and suspended matters
will not obstruct its action.</p>

<p>In the Report of the Jury the influence of the
curved shape of the radial arms is considered very
important in producing the effects. "If the vanes
be straight," the Report observes, "it is evident, that
whatever may be the velocity of the water in the
direction of a radius, when it leaves the wheel its velocity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
in the direction of a tangent will be that of the
circumference of the wheel, so that the greater the
velocity of the wheel the greater will be the amount
of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vis viva</i> remaining in the water when discharged,
and the greater the amount of power uselessly expended
to create that <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vis viva</i>. If, however, the vanes
be curved backwards as regards the motion of the
wheel, so as to have nearly the direction of a tangent
to the circumference of the wheel at the points where
they intersect it, the velocity due to the centrifugal
force of the water carrying over the surface of the
vane in the opposite direction to that in which the
wheel is moving, and nearly in the direction of a tangent
to the circumference, will&mdash;if this velocity of the
water over the vane in the one direction be equal to
that in which the vane is itself moving in the other&mdash;produce
a state of absolute rest in the water, and
entire exhaustion of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vis viva</i>." It is an interesting
fact in the history of the invention, that the curved
form was formerly adopted in some of the American
pumps, and afterwards abandoned.</p>

<p>There are competing claims to the invention of
Centrifugal Pumps in the form now adopted. This
kind of pump is stated to have been used in America
in 1830. M. Charles Combe took out a patent in
France for a similar pump in 1838; but though Mr.
Appold was later in the field with his more perfect
machine, he appears to have proceeded independently
of previous inventors.</p>

<h2><a name="TUBULAR_BRIDGES" id="TUBULAR_BRIDGES">TUBULAR BRIDGES.</a></h2>

<p>No sooner had the formation of railways commenced
for carrying passengers in long trains of carriages
drawn by heavy locomotive engines, than the
want was experienced of some different kind of bridge
from any then existing for crossing rivers, roads, and
valleys. The train could not be turned sharply round
a curve to cross a road at right angles; and to make
the requisite bend to enable it to do so would have
taken the railway considerably out of its direct course.
To overcome this difficulty "skew bridges" were designed,
that crossed roads and canals in slanting directions.
Iron girder bridges were also constructed,
and thus the railway trains were carried across roads
and narrow rivers at any required inclination, supported
on flat beams of iron. Suspension bridges
were found to be unfitted, on account of their oscillation,
for the passage of locomotive engines; therefore,
when it became necessary to carry railways
across arms of the sea, or wide navigable rivers, at
heights sufficient to allow the largest ships to pass
underneath, neither girder bridges nor suspension
bridges were suited for the purpose. Then arose the
necessity of contriving some form of bridge of extensive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
span that would be sufficiently strong and rigid
for railway trains to pass over them in safety.</p>

<p>The Britannia Bridge, across the Menai Straits,
was a triumphant response to the call for a new kind
of suspended roadway adapted to the requirements of
railways. The tubular principle of construction, designed
by Mr. Robert Stephenson, was practically
tested by Mr. Fairbairn; and the result of numerous
experiments on the strength of iron, in different forms
and combinations, established the soundness of that
principle. The rigidity and strength of the Britannia
Bridge depend on cellular cavities at the top and
bottom, which, acting as so many tubes, give stability
to the riveted plates of iron, and enable the bridge to
bear the immense pressure and vibration of a heavy
railway train without deflecting more than half an
inch.</p>

<p>It was Mr. Stephenson's original intention to make
a circular or oval tube, suspended by chains, for the
trains to run through; but Mr. Fairbairn's experiments
proved that a rectangular shape is stronger,
provided the top and bottom, which bear the greatest
part of the strain, are made rigid, either by additional
plates of iron, or by tubes. The notion of a circular
tube was, therefore, abandoned, and the rectangular
form, with cells at the top and bottom, was adopted;
first for the railway bridge at Conway, and afterwards
for the much greater work across the Menai Straits.</p>

<p>It has been stated by Mr. Stephenson, that the
idea of forming a tubular bridge was suggested by
experience gained in constructing the railway bridge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
at Ware, which consisted of a wrought-iron cellular
platform; but a more exact representation of the principle
on which the Britannia Bridge is constructed
had been long previously seen across the Rhine, at
Schauffhausen, where a rectangular tube, or hollow
girder, made of wood, was erected in 1757. That
bridge, though of different material, was in its principle
of construction similar to the iron tubular
bridges at Conway and at the Menai Straits. Another
similar bridge, carried over the river Limmat, at
Wettingen, constructed in 1778, had a span of 390
feet; and that, as well as the former, was raised to
its position in one piece, by means of powerful screw-jaws.
These curious and interesting structures,
which may be considered the forerunners of the
gigantic iron Tubular Bridges of the present day,
were burnt by the French in 1799.</p>

<p>In constructing the Britannia Bridge, Mr. Stephenson
took advantage of a rock midway from shore to
shore, whereon to erect the central pier. Two other
piers, at a distance, on each side, of 460 feet, were
built without much difficulty in shallower water, and
between these and the masonry on each side was a
distance of 230 feet. There are eight rectangular
tubes resting on those piers, to form two lines of railway,
each tube being 28 feet high and 14 feet wide,
exclusive of the cellular cavities at the top and bottom.
These cavities are rectangular, and extend
from one end of the bridge to the other, and may be
regarded as long tubes. There are eight of them at
the top, each 1 foot 9 inches square, and there are six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
at the bottom, the latter being 2 feet 4 inches wide,
and the same depth as those at the top. Sound is
conveyed through these cavities as readily as through
speaking tubes, and conversation can be thus easily
carried on across the Straits.</p>

<p>The height of the central pier of the Britannia
Bridge, from the foundation to the top, is 230 feet;
and the height of the roadway above high water
mark is 104 feet. The length of the large tubes,
through which the railway carriages pass, on each
side of the central pier, is 460 feet: and the total
length from shore to shore, 1,531 feet. The tubes
are connected together at the piers to give the bridge
additional strength, and they are composed altogether
of 186,000 separate pieces of iron, which were pierced
with seven millions of holes, and united together by
upwards of two millions of rivets. The whole mass
of iron employed weighed 10,540 tons.</p>

<p>The Britannia Bridge was commenced in May,
1846, and the first of the main tubes was completed
in June, 1849. The work was carried on close to the
bridge, on the Anglesea shore; and when the tube
was ready to be transported to its place on the piers,
which had been prepared to receive it, eight flat-bottomed
pontoons were provided to carry it, which,
being brought underneath, floated the ponderous
mass on the water as they rose with the tide.</p>

<p>The floating and fixing in its place of the tube
took place on the 27th of the same month, in view
of an immense concourse of spectators. After the
preliminary arrangements for letting go had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
completed, Mr. Stephenson, and other engineers, got
on the tube, with Captain Claxton, R.&nbsp;N., to whom
the management of the floating was entrusted. A
correspondent of the <i>Illustrated London News</i> thus
describes the proceeding, and its successful result:&mdash;"Captain
Claxton was easily distinguished by his
speaking trumpet, and there were also men to hold
the letters which indicated the different capstans, so
that no mistake could occur as to which capstan
should be worked; and flags, red, blue, and white,
signified what particular movement should be made.
About 7.30 p.m. the first perceptible motion, which
indicated that the tide was lifting the mass, was observed,
and at Mr. Stephenson's desire, the depth
of water was ascertained, and the exact time noted.
In a few minutes the motion was plainly visible, the
tube being fairly moved forward some inches. This
moment was one of intense interest, the huge bulk
gliding as gently and easily forward as if she had
been but a small boat. The spectators seemed spellbound,
for no shouts or exclamations were heard, as
all watched anxiously the silent course of the heavily
freighted pontoons. The only sounds heard were the
shouts of Captain Claxton, as he gave directions to
'let go ropes,' to 'haul in faster,' &amp;c.; and 'broadside
on,' the tube floated majestically in the centre
of the stream. I then left my station, and ran to the
entrance of the works, where I got into a boat, and
bade the men pull out as far as they could into the
middle of the Straits. This was no easy task, the tide
running strong; but it afforded me several splendid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
views of the floating mass, and one was especially
fine; the tube coming direct on through the stream&mdash;the
distant hills covered with trees, two or three
small vessels and a steamer, its smoke blending well
with the scene, forming a capital background; whilst
on one side, in long stretching perspective, stood the
three unfinished tubes, destined ere long to form,
with the one then speeding on its journey, one grand
and unique roadway. It was impossible to see this
grand and imposing sight, and not to feel its singleness,
if we may so speak. Anything so mighty of its
kind had never been before: again it would assuredly
be; but it was like the first voyage made by the first
steam-vessel&mdash;something until then unique. At 8.35
the tube was nearing the Anglesea pier, and at this
moment the expectation of the spectators was greatly
increased, as the tube was so near its destination:
and soon all fears were dispelled, as the Anglesea
end of the tube passed beyond the pier, and then the
Britannia pier end neared its appointed spot, and it
was instantly drawn back close to the recess, so as to
rest on the bearing intended for it. There was then
a pause for a few minutes, while waiting for the tide
to turn: and when that took place, the huge bulk
floated gently into its place on the Anglesea pier,
rested on the bearing there, and was instantly made
fast, so that it could not move again. The cheering,
till now subdued, was loud and hearty, and some
pieces of cannon on the shore gave token, by their
loud booming, that the great task of the day was
done."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
The tube, when in position, was lowered down
upon its bearings on the pier by opening valves in
the pontoons, which thus sunk sufficiently to ease
them of their load.</p>

<p>The work of raising the tube to its position, 100
feet above high water mark, was a much slower
operation, and was attended with serious difficulties.
Hydraulic presses were used for the purpose, placed
at the top of the piers; two smaller ones, which had
served to raise the Conway Bridge, being at one end,
and a much larger press, made for the occasion, being
fixed at the other. The immense tube was lifted by
chains fixed to the heads of the presses, and two steam
engines, of 40-horse power each, were employed to
force the water into the cylinders. The diameter of
the ram of the largest hydraulic press was 20 inches,
and the pressure upon it was equal to 2¼ tons on each
circular inch. The tube was raised by successive lifts
of 6 feet each, and, as it was lifted, the space was
built in with masonry for its ultimate bearing. During
the operation of lifting, the bottom of the cylinder
of the large hydraulic press burst out, and fell on the
top of the tube, in which it made a considerable indentation.
Mr. Stephenson had provided against the
possibility of such accident, by having blocks of wood,
an inch thick, introduced under the tube as it was
elevated, and these blocks arrested its fall, or it would
otherwise have been dashed to pieces. Even the
small fall of an inch did considerable injury. This
accident caused some delay, but the other tubes were
in the meantime progressing, and the completed bridge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
was opened for public traffic on the 21st of October,
1850.</p>

<p>The strength of the bridge was tested before passenger
trains were allowed to pass through it, by
placing in the centre of the longest tubes twenty-eight
waggons, loaded with 280 tons of coal, and two locomotives,
and by afterwards sending those heavy trains
through the bridge at full speed. The deflection of
the tubes in the centre amounted to only three-quarters
of an inch in each cell; it being rather less when
the trains were at full speed than when stationary.
The strongest gusts of wind to which the bridge has
been exposed have not caused a vibration of more
than one inch. The total cost of construction was
£601,865; of which sum £3,986 was for experiments,
and £158,704 for masonry.</p>

<p>Another Tubular Bridge of rival magnitude to the
one across the Menai Straits is now in the course of
construction by Mr. Brunel across the Tamar, at
Saltash, for the South Devon and Cornwall Railway.
As no rock presented itself conveniently halfway
across whereon to erect the central pier, Mr. Brunel
was obliged to work at a great depth below the surface
of the water in making the foundation of the Royal
Albert Bridge. In the plan of making the foundation,
as well as in the structure of the bridge itself,
Mr. Brunel adopted a course altogether original. Instead
of attempting to construct a coffer-dam by piles,
which would have been almost impracticable at such
a depth, and very costly, he caused a large iron tube
to be put together, thirty-six feet in diameter, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
ninety-six feet long, to reach to the bed of the river.
This monster tube was lowered perpendicularly in the
middle of the river, and the water being pumped out
of it, the men could work at the bottom in safety. In
this manner, after much labour, the rock was prepared
to receive the blocks of granite, which were
laid one on the other, till they rose above the surface
of the water. On that granite pedestal a cast-iron
pier was raised to a height of 100 feet, the level of
the roadway of the rails.</p>

<p>The cast-iron pier consists of four octagon columns,
10 feet in diameter. They stand about 10 feet apart,
forming a square, and they are bound together by
massive lattice-work of wrought iron, to prevent any
lateral movement. Each of these columns weighs
150 tons; and when the full weight of the bridge
rests on the foundation of the central pier, the pressure
will be equal to 8 tons on the square foot, or double
the pressure of the Victoria Tower on its base.</p>

<p>In the structure of the bridge, Mr. Brunel availed
himself of the results of the experiments made by Mr.
Fairbairn on the strength of iron tubes, but he adopted
a very different plan from that of Mr. Stephenson.
Instead of constructing a large tube for the trains to
pass through, Mr. Brunel made tubular arches, consisting
of iron plates curved and riveted together, to
serve as rigid supports, from which the roadway is
suspended by chains and by connecting iron bars.</p>

<p>The placing of the first of the tubular arches in
position between the pier near the shore at Saltash
and the central pier, which took place on the 1st of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
September, 1857, excited great interest, and at least
50,000 persons were assembled from places far and
near to witness the operation. The tube, with the
roadway and suspension chains, was floated from the
yard where it was put together on four pontoons; and
it was thus conveyed, and safely deposited on the
piers at a height of 30 feet above high water mark.
It was afterwards gradually raised by hydraulic presses
to the top, a height of 100 feet. The work of raising
it commenced on the 25th of November, and was
completed on the 19th of May last.</p>

<p>The following lively description of the Royal
Albert Bridge, and its surrounding scenery, extracted
from a recent article in the <i>Times</i>, gives a very good
idea of the magnitude of the structure, by comparison
with well-known objects:&mdash;"Though, probably, our
readers may care little and have heard less about
Saltash proper, it is likely henceforth to receive a fair
share of general attention, and we can safely say, to
those who will journey down to see the bridge, that
the viaduct requires indeed to be a fine one to attract
their attention from the lovely scenery of the valley
of the Tamar, which it crosses. The banks of this
noble river narrow in considerably as the stream
reaches Saltash, and, hemmed in there to half a mile
or so, suddenly widens out into as fine a sheet of water
as any of its kind in the kingdom, its distant banks
covered with cottages, and fringed with undulating
woodlands down to the very edge. Across this narrow
part of the channel, where Saltash, in picturesque
dirt and disarray, straggles up the banks on one side,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
and a steep hill, covered with rock and rock-grown
underwood, forms the other, the viaduct stretches
high in air. The briefest general way of describing
it is to say that it consists of nineteen spans or arches,
seventeen of which are wider than the widest arches of
Westminster Bridge; and two, resting on a single
cast-iron pier of four columns in the centre of the
river, span the whole stream at one gigantic leap of
910 feet, or a longer distance than the breadth of the
Thames at Westminster. The total length of the
structure from end to end is 2,240 feet,&mdash;very nearly
half a mile, and 300 feet longer than the entire stretch
of the Britannia Bridge. The greatest width is only
30 feet at basement; its greatest height from foundation
to summit no less than 260 feet, or 50 feet
higher than the summit of the Monument. The
Britannia Bridge, both in size, purpose, and engineering
importance, seems to offer the best comparison
with that of Saltash, but the similarity between the
structures is far from being as great as might be at
first supposed. The Britannia tube is smaller, and
cost nearly four times the price of the Saltash Viaduct,
though the engineers had natural facilities which Mr.
Brunel, for his Cornish bridge, certainly had not."</p>

<p>The form of the tubes is an oval, 17 feet in its
longest diameter, and 12 feet in its shortest. They
are bent into an elliptical curve, with a rise in the
middle of twenty-eight feet. With the roadway and
suspension chains attached, each tube weighs 1,100
tons. The total weight of wrought iron in the bridge,
when completed, will be 2,650 tons; of cast iron,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
1,200; of masonry and brickwork there will be about
17,000 cubic yards; and of timber, about 14,000
cubic feet.</p>

<p>The second tube, which is in every respect like the
first, was completed on the 30th of June last, and on
the 10th of July was successfully placed in position
between the central pier and the Devonshire side of
the river. The operation of elevating it began on the
9th of August, and it has now reached nearly the
level of the first one, the tube being raised six feet in
a week.</p>

<p>The engraving on the other side is a view of this
wonderful structure in its completed form. Its appearance
is far more light and elegant than that of the
Britannia Bridge, but it remains to be seen whether
it will be equally steady under a gale of wind, and
whether any vibration of the suspended roadway will
interfere with the rapid motion of the trains. As the
South Devon Railway has only one line of rails for
the greater portion of its length, but a single roadway
is provided on the Royal Albert Bridge.</p>

<p>The progress of railway locomotion has not only
given rise to the construction of new kinds of bridges,
but it has directed mechanical science to devise better
means of applying the strength of materials. On the
South Devon and Cornwall Railways are to be seen
wooden viaducts, carrying the line over valleys at
great heights, constructed with such slender timbers,
that, to an inexperienced eye, they seem frightfully
frail for the support of heavy railway trains.</p>

<div id="ip_293" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><img src="images/i_b_294.jpg" width="600" height="374" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption">ROYAL ALBERT BRIDGE, OVER THE TAMAR, AT SALTASH.</div></div>

<p>We must not omit to notice, among the remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
bridge erections connected with railways, the viaduct
across the valley of the Boyne, which passes over the
river close to the town of Drogheda, at a height of 95
feet. The central portion of the viaduct is supported
on four piers, 90 feet above high water mark, with a
span in the centre of 250 feet, and on each side of 125
feet. This elevated portion of the work is approached
on the southern side by twelve arches, of 60 feet span
each, and on the north by three similar arches. The
viaduct is constructed of limestone and iron lattice-work,
and is calculated to bear 7,200 tons.</p>

<p>During the erection of this viaduct the railway
trains were carried over the valley on a wooden platform,
without side railings, supported by scaffold-poles;
and the crackling of the timbers, as the carriages
passed over it, and the dizzy height at which
they were carried through the air, produced a sensation
of terror in nervous passengers, that was fully
justified by the apparent danger.</p>

<h2><a name="SELF-ACTING_ENGINES" id="SELF-ACTING_ENGINES">SELF-ACTING ENGINES.</a></h2>

<p>The manufacturing progress of this country has
depended, in a great degree, on the facility possessed
of making machinery of all kinds by the aid of powerful
engines worked by steam power. These engines,
most of which appear to be self-acting, forge and roll
and cut and bore beams of iron, boiler plates, and
cylinders of immense size, which it would be impossible
to make by hand; and they do the work with a
rapidity and mechanical accuracy that would be
otherwise unattainable. In the progress of manufacturing
invention, the small steam engine first made by
manual labour created the power to make other steam
engines of large size; and those more powerful engines
supplied the means of making still larger shafts
and cylinders for engines that were to be employed in
the construction of machines of various kinds, to be
worked by the power thus accumulated.</p>

<p>The important advantages derived from the invention
and application of self-acting machinery, not only
by the community at large, but even by the workmen
whose labour they for a time superseded, were forcibly
stated by Mr. Whitworth, in his opening address at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, in September,
1856:&mdash;"I congratulate you," he observed, "on the
success which in our time the mechanical arts have
obtained, and the high consideration in which they
are held. Inventors are not now persecuted, as formerly,
by those who fancied that their inventions and
discoveries were prejudicial to the general interest,
and calculated to deprive labour of its fair reward.
Some of us are old enough to remember the hostility
manifested to the working of the power-loom, the
self-acting mule, the machinery for shearing woollen
cloth, the thrashing machine, and many others. Now
the introduction of reaping and mowing machines,
and other improved agricultural machinery, is not
opposed. Indeed, it must be obvious, to reflecting
minds, that the increased luxuries and comforts which
all more or less enjoy, are derived from the numerous
recent mechanical appliances and the productions of
our manufactories. That of our cotton has increased
during the last few years in a wonderful degree. In
1824, a gentleman with whom I am acquainted sold
on one occasion 100,000 pieces of 74-reed printing
cloth at 30s. 6d. per piece of 29 yards long; the same
description of cloth he sold last week at 3s. 9d. One
of the most striking instances I know of the vast superiority
of machinery over simple instruments used by
hand, is in the manufacture of lace, when one man,
with a machine, does the work of 8,000 lace makers
on the cushion. In spinning fine numbers of yarn, a
workman in a self-acting mule will do the work of
3,000 hand-spinners with the distaff and spindle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
"Comparatively few persons, perhaps, are aware
of the increase of production in our life-time. Thirty
years ago, the cost of labour for turning a surface of
cast iron, by chipping and filing with the hand, was
12s. per square foot&mdash;the same work is now done by
the planing machine at a cost for labour of less than
one penny per square foot: and this, as you know, is
one of the most important operations in mechanics; it
is, therefore, well adapted to illustrate what our progress
has been. At the same time that this increased
production is taking place, the fixed capital of the
country is, as a necessary consequence, augmented;
for in the case I have mentioned, of chipping and filing
by the hand, when the cost of labour was 12s. per
foot, the capital required for tools for one workman
was only a few shillings; but now, the labour being
lowered to a penny per foot, a capital in planing
machines for the workman is required which often
amounts to £500, and in some cases more."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the great economy of labour by
the self-acting machines now employed for doing all
kinds of work, it is gratifying to find that it has not
had the effect of throwing men out of employ; for the
increased demand, consequent on the facility of production,
has more than compensated for the substitution
of automaton mechanism for handicraft.</p>

<p>It is extremely interesting to visit a large engineering
factory, and to witness the ease with which the
masses of crude metal are wrought in various ways,
and converted by a number of seemingly self-acting
engines into other engines and machines which are,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
in their turn, to become the agents of the further development
of the skill and ingenuity of man. In the
new Government factory at Keyham, near Devonport,
which we believe to be one of the largest establishments
of the kind in the world, most of those
powerful engines of the best construction may be seen
in operation. The completeness of the arrangements
redounds much to the credit of Mr. Trickett, the chief
engineer, under whose supervision they were made;
and a walk through the factory, which is thrown open
to public inspection, will well repay a journey of
many miles. A detailed description of all its machinery
would fill a volume, but we must now limit
ourselves to a bare enumeration of some of the most
remarkable features.</p>

<p>Numerous machines of the largest size, placed under
the cover of an extensive and lofty roof, are employed
in doing everything requisite for the fitting
out of the largest steam-ships in the British navy.
Shears, put in continuous motion by steam power, are
seen moving steadily up and down, and cutting
through the thickest boiler plates without the least
apparent effort, the chisel-shaped knives that cut the
metal moving just the same whether they be dividing
the air or shearing iron. Punching engines, in like
manner, force holes through iron plates an inch thick.
Shaping and planing machines pare off the tough iron
as if it were not harder than cheese. Riveting machines
of different kinds bind together the plates of
monster boilers with marvellous rapidity; whilst
machines for boring, for drilling, for forging, and for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
doing every variety of smaller work, are to be seen
in operation in various parts of the factory.</p>

<p>Among the smaller self-acting engines, the forging
machine for making bolts attracts attention by the
rapidity of its action. It consists of a series of hammers
placed side by side, so constructed as to shape
small bars of iron into any required form, according
to the mould of the swages beneath them, representing
miniature anvils. It is interesting to watch how
readily the hot iron receives its shape under the action
of the hammers, which make about 700 strokes per
minute, the work being transferred from one to another
to be progressively finished. There is a circular saw
that cuts through bars of iron as thick as railway rails,
by making upwards of 1,000 revolutions per minute.
A rivet-making machine forms the rivet, and shapes
the head to the requisite size, with great accuracy
and quickness. There are compound drilling machines,
in which six drills are acting simultaneously; hydraulic
presses, that force parts of machines together,
and a great variety of other engines for the saving of
time and labour.</p>

<p>Not the least curious of the smaller contrivances
is an apparatus which deserves notice as a useful application
of magnetism to manufacturing purposes.
Several horse-shoe magnets are attached to two endless
chains, moving over suitable wheels, and inclined
at an angle of 30 degrees. These magnets at the
lower end of the chain, dip into a tub containing the
mixed brass and iron turnings and filings from the
lathes and other tools, and the pieces of iron, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
attracted by the magnets, are carried away and
brushed off into a box, leaving the brass behind to be
remelted.</p>

<p>In one department of the building are immense
foundry furnaces, where metals are melted and cast,
the blast of the fires being maintained by large rotating
fans, kept in action by a powerful steam engine,
by which also the other machines are worked. The
foundry is most conveniently contrived for casting
works of any required size, fixed and travelling cranes
being so stationed and arranged as to carry the ladles
of liquid metal to any part of the floor.</p>

<p>In another department is the smithy, where the
iron to be wrought into shape is heated in forges;
and near to the forges stand the Steam-Hammers&mdash;those
gigantic Cyclops of modern times, that strike
blows, compared with the force of which the blows of
the fabled Cyclops of antiquity were but as the fall
of a feather.</p>

<p>Ranged in a row there are four of these ponderous
engines, of various sizes; the largest hammer being
so heavy as to require the power of four tons to lift it,
and when falling from a height of 6 feet nothing can
withstand its crushing blow. Yet the force of this
mighty giant is so completely under control, and may
be brought to act so gently, as scarcely to crack a nut
placed to receive its fall.</p>

<p>The invention of the steam-hammer was the result
of necessity. The shaft of a steam engine having to
be made larger than usual, no hammer then in action
by water power was capable of forging it, and Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
James Nasmyth was applied to, to give his aid in
contriving the means of removing the difficulty. It
was then that the idea of lifting the hammer-block by
the direct action of steam occurred to him, and by a
succession of extremely ingenious devices, he at
length perfected the steam-hammer, which has been
pronounced to be one of the most perfect artificial
machines, and one of the noblest triumphs of mind
over matter that modern English engineers have yet
developed.</p>

<p>The accompanying woodcut represents the largest
of the four steam-hammers in Keyham factory. The
hammer-block, <i>a</i>, weighing four tons, is guided in
its ascent and fall by grooves in two massive uprights,
which hold the whole together. The hammer-block
is lifted by the piston-rod of the steam cylinder
above it, which is made of such diameter, that the
pressure of the steam on the surface of the piston may
considerably overbalance the weight of the hammer-block,
and overcome the friction of the connecting
mechanism. The cylinder of the largest steam-hammer
at Keyham is 18 inches diameter, which gives an
area of 254 square inches; and the pressure of the
steam generally used being fifty pounds on the square
inch, the total steam pressure tending to force the
piston up, when the whole of it is brought to bear, is
equal to five tons and a half. The force of the blow
of the hammer, when falling from its greatest height,
is equal to 144 tons.</p>

<p>By the arrangements of levers, screws, and pipes
and valves, shown in the engraving, the steam is first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
admitted under the piston, and thus acts directly in
forcing it up, with the heavy hammer-block attached
to the piston rod. When the block has been raised
to the required height, it strikes against the end of a
lever, which then shuts off the steam, and allows it to
escape; whereupon the hammer falls with its full
force vertically on the anvil. The end of the lever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
which turns off the steam may be adjusted at any
height, according to the required force of the blow, so
that the hammer may fall from a height of six feet, or
be merely raised a few inches.</p>

<div id="ip_304" class="figcenter" style="width: 379px;"><img src="images/i_b_303.jpg" width="379" height="471" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>The steam-hammer, in the early stages of its invention,
required an attendant to turn on the steam
again at the end of each stroke, but Mr. Nasmyth ingeniously
contrived the means of rendering the engine
altogether self-acting, by causing the force of the collision
to release a spring that holds down the slide-valve;
and by this contrivance a continued and
regular succession of blows is maintained without any
assistance.</p>

<p>Not only can the force of the blow be regulated
by the height to which the hammer is lifted, but the
ponderous mass may be arrested in its descent by admitting
the steam under the piston, so that a skilful
manipulator can stop it within the eighth of an inch
from the anvil.</p>

<p>The Steam Engine itself, by which all the self-acting
mechanisms of a large factory are put in motion,
is, perhaps, after all, the most wonderful of inventions;
but it does not strictly come within our province,
for Watt had perfected his great work before the
close of the last century. It was, however, not much
used, excepting for mining purposes, until after the
commencement of the present; and the inventor himself
had but a faint idea of the value and vast importance
of the motive power he had placed at the command
of man. So little, indeed, was the value of
steam power appreciated in the early years of its application,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
that no notice is taken of the steam engine
in Beckmann's History of Inventions, though Watt
had completed his condensing engines several years
before that work was published; and Newcomen's
steam engine had been at work at least sixty years.</p>

<p>The history of the steam engine affords a striking
example of the gradual development of an invention
from vague and chimerical notions, into an accomplished
fact of astonishing magnitude. As in the
electric telegraph the dreams of the alchemist are fully
realized by the applications of scientific discovery, so
in the wonder-working powers of the steam engine
one of the visionary schemes sketched in the "Century
of Inventions" is practically extended far beyond
the conceptions of its fanciful projector. How little
could Beckmann have supposed that an invention,
which he considered too insignificant to be mentioned,
would, in the course of fifty years, have revolutionized
the world! It may possibly be the same, before this
century is closed, with inventions that are now neglected
or despised.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The record in the preceding pages of some of the
most remarkable applications of science during the
present century, exhibits an amount of intelligence, of
skill, and of power that seems, when viewed in its
completed form, to be superhuman. It is only by
tracing each invention to its source, and by noting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
step by step advances by which it has arrived at its
present state, that we can bring ourselves to believe
that the great development of power and the display
of ingenuity we witness, can have been accomplished
by ordinary men. This feeling of admiration, at the
results of human industry and inventive genius, was
strongly excited on passing through the wonderful
collection of the works of all nations in the Great Exhibition
of 1851. After walking through the long
avenues, crowded with the most highly finished manufactured
goods, and with works of art, adapted to every
purpose and capable of gratifying every luxurious
taste of highly civilized life, we beheld, in another
part of the building, the self-acting machines by
which many of those productions had been manufactured.
We saw various mechanisms, moving without
hands to guide them, producing the most elaborate
works; massive steam engines,&mdash;the representatives
of man's power,&mdash;and exquisite contrivances, displaying
his ingenuity and perseverance; and we felt inclined
to exalt the attributes of humanity, and to think
that nothing could surpass the productions there displayed.
But as if to repress such vainglorious
thoughts, there stood in the transept of the building,
surrounded by and contrasting with the handiworks
of man, one of the simplest productions of Nature.
Every single leaf on the spreading branches of that
magnificent tree exhibited in its structure, in its self-supporting
and self-acting mechanism, and in the
adaptation of surrounding circumstances for its maintenance,
an amount of intelligent design and contrivance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
and power, with which there was nothing to
compare. After examining the intricate ramifications
of arteries and veins for spreading the sap throughout
the leaf, and the innumerable pores for inhaling and
exuding the gases and moisture necessary for its continued
existence; after carrying the mind beyond the
beautiful structure itself, to consider the provisions of
heat and moisture and air, without which all that
mechanism would have been useless; and having reflected
on the presence of the mysterious principle
which actuated the whole arrangement of fibres, and
gave life to the crude elements of matter,&mdash;we could
not fail to be impressed with the insignificance of the
most elaborate productions of man, when compared
with the smallest work of the Omnipotent Creator.</p>

<h3 class="vspace">Class-book of Chemistry.</h3>

<p class="p1 center larger">BY E. L. YOUMANS.</p>

<p class="p1 center bold">12mo. 340 pages. Price 75 cents.</p>

<p class="p2">Every page of this book bears evidence of the author's superior
ability of perfectly conforming his style to the capacity of youth.
This is a merit rarely possessed by the authors of scientific school-books,
and will be appreciated by every discriminating teacher.
While Chemistry is almost universally regarded by students as a
dry and repulsive study (owing to the rigid and technical manner
in which it is presented), Mr. Youmans' work will be found pre-eminent
in clearness and simplicity of diction, by which the subject
is made at once interesting and attractive. It is especially commended
by the eminently practical manner in which each subject is presented.
Its illustrations are drawn largely from the phenomena of daily
experience, and the interest of the pupil is speedily awakened by
the consideration that Chemistry is not a matter belonging exclusively
to physicians and professors.</p>

<p class="p1 center"><i>From</i> <span class="smcap">Prof. Wm. H. Bigelow</span>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The eminently practical character of the Class-book, treating of the familiar applications
of the science, is, in my opinion, its chief excellence, and gives it a value
far superior to any other work now before the public.</p></blockquote>

<p class="p1 center"><i>From</i> <span class="smcap">David Syme</span>, A. M., <i>formerly Principal of the Math. Dept. and Lecturer in
Nat. Philosophy, Chemistry, and Physiology, in Columbia College</i>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Youmans</span>: Dear Sir,&mdash;I have carefully examined your Class-Book on Chemistry,
and, in my opinion, it is better adapted for use in schools and academies than
any other work on the subject that has fallen under my observation.</p>

<p>I hope that the success of your Class-Book will be proportionate to its merits,
and that your efforts to diffuse the knowledge of Chemistry will be duly appreciated
by the friends of education.</p></blockquote>

<p class="p1 center"><i>From</i> <span class="smcap">Prof. J. Mulligan</span>, <i>Principal of Young Ladies' School, New York</i>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We have a large number of school-books for the purpose of giving elementary
instruction in Chemistry&mdash;possessing various kinds and various degrees of merit;
but of all which I have examined, I should prefer the Class-Book of Chemistry, as the
most perspicuous in style and method, and as containing the happiest selection of
what is most interesting, and most practically valuable in the vast field of chemical
science.</p></blockquote>

<p class="p1 center"><i>From the N. Y. Commercial Advertiser.</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Either for schools or for general reading, we know of no elementary work on
Chemistry which in every respect pleases us so much as this.</p></blockquote>

<p class="p1 center"><i>From the Scientific American.</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Such a book, in the present state of chemical science, was demanded; but to present
the subject in such a clear, comprehensive manner, in a work of the size before
us, is more than we expected.</p>

<p>The author has happily succeeded in clothing his ideas in plain language&mdash;true
eloquence&mdash;so as to render the subject both interesting and easily comprehended.
The number of men who can write on science and write clearly, is small; but our
author is among that number.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Chemical Chart:</h3>

<p class="p1 center larger">BY E. L. YOUMANS.</p>

<p class="p1 center bold">On Rollers, 5 feet by 6 in size. New Edition. Price $5.</p>

<p>This popular work accomplishes for the first time, for Chemistry,
what maps and charts have for geography, geology, and astronomy,
by presenting a new and valuable mode of illustration. Its plan is
to represent chemical composition to the eye by colored diagrams,
so that numerous facts of proportion, structure, and relation,
which are the most difficult in the science, are presented to the
mind through the medium of the eye, and may thus be easily acquired
and long retained. The want of such a chart has long been
felt by the thoughtful teacher, and no other scientific publication
that has ever emanated from the American press has met with the
universal favor that has been accorded to this Chart. In the language
of a distinguished chemist, "Its appearance marks an era in
the progress of the popularization of Chemistry."</p>

<p>It illustrates the nature of elements, compounds, affinity, definite
and multiple proportions, acids, bases, salts, the salt-radical theory,
double decomposition, deoxidation, combustion and illumination,
isomerism, compound radicals, and the composition of the proximate
principles of food. It covers the whole field of Agricultural
Chemistry, and is invaluable as an aid to public lecturers, to teachers
in class-room recitation, and for reference in the family. The
mode of using it is explained in the class-book.</p>

<p class="p1 center"><i>From the late</i> <span class="smcap">Horace Mann</span>, <i>President of Antioch College</i>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I think Mr. Youmans is entitled to great credit for the preparation of his Chart,
because its use will not only facilitate acquisition, but, what is of far greater importance,
will increase the exactness and precision of the student's elementary ideas.</p></blockquote>

<p class="p1 center"><i>From</i> <span class="smcap">Dr. John W. Draper</span>, <i>Professor of Chemistry in the University of N.&nbsp;Y.</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mr. Youmans' Chart seems to me well adapted to communicate to beginners a
knowledge of the definite combinations of chemical substances, and as a preliminary
to the use of symbols, to aid them very much in the recollection of the examples it
contains. It deserves to be introduced into the schools.</p></blockquote>

<p class="p1 center bold">12mo. 365 pages. Price $1 25.</p>

<p>This translation is designed to supply a want long felt by both
teachers and students in our American colleges. We have valuable
histories of Philosophy in English, but no <i>manual</i> on this subject
so clear, concise, and comprehensive as the one now presented.
Schwegler's work bears the marks of great learning, and is evidently
written by one who has not only studied the original sources for
such a history, but has thought out for himself the systems of
which he treats. He has thus seized upon the real germ of each
system, and traced its process of development with great clearness
and accuracy. The whole history of speculation, from Thales to
the present time, is presented in its consecutive order. This rich
and important field of study, hitherto so greatly neglected, will, it is
hoped, receive a new impulse among American students through
Mr. Seelye's translation. It is a book, moreover, invaluable for
reference, and should be in the possession of every public and private
library.</p>

<p class="p1 center"><i>From</i> <span class="smcap">L. P. Hickok</span>, <i>Vice-President of Union College</i>.</p>

<p>"I have had opportunity to hear a large part of Rev. Mr. Seelye's translation of

that it is a faithful, clear, and remarkably precise English rendering of this invaluable
Epitome of the History of Philosophy. It is exceedingly desirable that it should be
given to American students of philosophy in the English language, and I have no expectation
of its more favorable and successful accomplishment than in this present
attempt. I should immediately introduce it as a text-book in the graduate's department
under my own instruction, if it be favorably published, and cannot doubt that
other teachers will rejoice to avail themselves of the like assistance from it."</p></blockquote>

<p>"I have examined this work with great pleasure, and do not hesitate to say that in
my judgment it is greatly superior to any treatise I have seen, in all the essential
requisites of a good text-book."</p></blockquote>

<p class="p1 center"><i>From</i> <span class="smcap">Prof. Rousseau D. Hitchcock, D. D.</span>, <i>of Union Theol. Sem., N.&nbsp;Y.</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The task of mediating between science and the popular mind, is one that requires
a peculiar gift of perspicuity, both in thought and style; and this, I think, the author
possesses in an eminent degree. I am pleased with its comprehensiveness, its plainness,
and its fidelity to the Christian stand-point."</p></blockquote>

<p class="p1 center"><i>From</i> <span class="smcap">Prof. Henry B. Smith, D. D.</span>, <i>of the Union Theol. Sem., N.&nbsp;Y.</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It commends itself by its clear arrangement of the topics, its perspicuity of language,
and its constant practical bearings. I am particularly pleased with its views of
conscience. Its frequent and pertinent illustrations, and the Scriptural character of its
explanations of the particular duties, will make the work both attractive and valuable
as a text-book, in imparting instruction upon this vital part of philosophy."</p></blockquote>

<p class="p1 center"><i>From</i> <span class="smcap">W. D. Wilson, D. D.</span>, <i>Professor of Intellectual and Moral Philosophy in
Hobart Free College</i>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have examined the work with care, and have adopted it as a text-book in the
study of Moral Science. I consider it not only sound in doctrine, but clear and systematic
in method, and withal pervaded with a prevailing healthy tone of sentiment,
which cannot fail to leave behind, in addition to the truths it inculcates, an impression
in favor of those truths. I esteem this one of the greatest merits of the book. In this
respect it has no equal, so far as I know; and I do not hesitate to speak of it as being
preferable to any other work yet published, for use in all institutions where Moral
Philosophy forms a department in the course of instruction."</p></blockquote>
